Me :
1. cite my LTC paper

2.how do we add about the creation of multi-lingual dictionary creation of urdu sindhi hindi ?
- dictionary helped in inducing some morph features while creating morph-analyser.. features such as lexical category and gender.

<spectre> you haven't written anything about which parts of the verbal paradigm we cover
<spectre> and which parts we do not 
<raveesh> parts.. in term of tenses/persons right ?
<spectre> yes
<spectre> i hope we cover all persons!!!
<raveesh> yes we do
<raveesh> we conver quite a many tenses as well
<raveesh> *cover
<spectre> :)
<raveesh> but not all extreme ones like future habitual or something
<spectre> ok, so write that in the article
<spectre> and give an example
<raveesh> alright :)
<spectre> in fact we could do a table
<raveesh> of the tenses/forms that we have and we dont ?
<spectre> with Verb Tense | Form | Covered 
<raveesh> dont you think that's make it more dense, we already have loads of figures and tables
<spectre> yeah, it would be better if we could do it in prose
<raveesh> okay

3. about verbs :
<spectei> i am not happy
<spectei> with the description in 2.2.2.
<spectei> the reviewers asked us to describe the forms that were covered
<spectei> and the forms that aren't covered
<spectei> and i agreed
<spectei> also we are 5.5 pages/8 pages
<spectei> so we have plenty of space
<raveesh> in 2.2.2.
<raveesh> there 2 things pointed by reviewers
<raveesh> 1. added the comment about transitivity
<raveesh> and the other was
<raveesh> => here you suddenly mix the description of the language and structure of your
<raveesh> analyser, stay consistent! Also if you mention that not all forms are covered,
	<raveesh> what is the percentage of covered verbs
	<raveesh> i have mentioned in text the forms that arent present
	<raveesh> how do i give an estimate in number when i myself am not aware of all kinds of verb forms ?
	<raveesh> *estimate in percentage
	<spectei> they should be described by the grammar
	<raveesh> that website that we were following ?
	<spectei> "according to the grammar of X (YYYY), the following inflectional forms have been implemented:"
	<spectei> "however, the ZZZ, KKK, JJJ forms have not yet been implemented as described"
	<spectei>  
	<raveesh> http://www.ciil-lisindia.net/Sindhi/sindhi_struct.html ?
	<spectei> you could also give examples of the forms implemented and those not implemented

In other places, facts are listed without pointing out their relevance to your
work and drawing conclusions.

There are repeated formatting errors and figures are hard to read and miss
explanations/references.


4: 

Figure 2: The subtext should be included in running text rather than being below the figure to improve
readability.

Figure 1: Why is figure 1 placed after figure 2, the functionality of the
lexicon entry in figure 1 should either be described to the reader or left out.

Figure 3: the subline of the figure should be
part of the text for better readability. Also an explanation of it is missing,
i.e. what do you want to illustrate with it? Since you disambiguated it
manually, it does not show the morphological analyser's ability to give various
analyses, so what do you want to illustrate?


5.3 
"There are quite a few reason that we think why our analyser
make the mistakes that it did."
=> what is the evidence for you thinking that?

<spectei> yeah, we should mention this

spectre> we can just rewrite the sentence
<raveesh> sure, are you able to edit the latex ?
<spectre> There are a number of reasons behind the mistakes that our analyser made. 
<spectre>  
<spectre> just put it like this
<spectre> that way we remove "we thought" and it is a statement not a supposition :)
<spectre> and we list them afterwards
