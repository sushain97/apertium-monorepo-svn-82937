------

Basic workflow is like the following:
	1) mv kaz-kaa-nova.txt kaz-kaa-origina.txt
	2) run diff on kaz-kaa-origina.txt and corpus.kaa.txt,
	3) see what is to fix/to improve,
	4) fix them and compile,
	5) run ./qa.sh kaz-kaa-corp to see whether you really fixed them,
	6) commit,
	
	repeat the cycle

'qa.sh kaz-kaa-corp' in apertium-kaz-kaa/ gives a coloured diff of "origina" and "nova" translations.

The same workflow applies for the opposite direction.
