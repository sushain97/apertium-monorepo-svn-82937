AN ACT TO POSTPONE THE ELECTIONS TO CERTAIN LOCAL BODIES WHICH ARE DUE TO BE HELD IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1923 AND TO ENABLE THE ELECTIONS TO OTHER LOCAL BODIES WHICH ARE DUE TO BE HELD IN THE YEAR 1923 TO BE POSTPONED AND TO MAKE CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONSEQUENTIAL ON SUCH POSTPONEMENTS.

WHEREAS under the Statutes now in force in Saorstát Eireann elections of the members of borough, county borough and urban district councils and of town commissioners are required to be held in the month of January 1923 and elections of members of county and rural district councils and of other local bodies are required to be held in the month of June and at divers other times in the year 1923:
		

AND WHEREAS owing to the non-completion of the Register of Local Government Electors now in course of preparation and for other reasons it is necessary that the said elections required to be held in the month of January 1923 should be postponed to a later date in that year and for the like reasons it may become necessary that some or all of the said elections required to be held at other times in the year 1923 should also be postponed:
