Gaupol extension for getting Machine Translation suggestions from a
local Apertium installation. 


Prerequisites:
- gaupol
- apertium
- a language pair of your choice


After installing, click the Apertium menu and Translate. You can then
select the translation direction, and click OK to translate. The
translations go into the "translation" column. NOTE: anything that was
there from before will be overwritten! Fortunately you can just undo
it :-)



Ideas:
- is it possible to find the source language somehow? Then we might be
  able to filter down the mode list...
- ability to select certain rows and only translate those
- or perhaps ability to get "suggestions" instead somehow? Probably
  can do a lot of fancy UI stuff here...
- a field for usermodes in preferences, e.g. just a multiline text
  box where users can paste in paths to specific .mode files, for
  running non-installed development versions
