Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 10
Walcome tae pairt ten o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we learn aboot Chancy Dauvit, the laddie king that wis a guest in Fraunce, a presonar in Ingland, an a pawkie cheil at hame. HOOSE O THE BRUCE Dauvit II The Chancy 1329-1371 Born 5 Mairch 1324 at Dumfaurlin, in Fife, he wis the ae son o Robert I an Leezabeth o Burgh. At the age o jist fower, Dauvit wis mairried on Jean Plantagenet o Ingland, on 12 July 1328 at Berrick, as the price o peace atween the twa kinriks. Born on 5 July 1321, at the touer o Lunnon, Jean wis seeven year auld at her mairrage, her faither bein Edwart II an her mither Isabella Capet o Fraunce. Jist a year efter this waddin, in Juin 1329, King Robert dee’d an Scotland haed a five year auld king. Auld King Robert’s nevey, Tamas Randal erle o Moray, wis noo the guardian o the kinrik in name o Dauvit. But it wis a whilie afore wee Dauvit wis crount. The Scots haed wantit the paip tae send haly yle fae Rome as a mark o Scotland’s freestaunin kingship, an at his crounin on 24 November 1331, at Scoun, Dauvit wis the first Scots king tae hae his heid droukit in haly yle. Dauvit haed the ill sonse tae come tae the throne as a bairn. The war a hantle o Scots lords in Ingland – unfreens o the Bruce – ready tae come hame an tak back thair auld lands, an jist as mony Inglis lords wi sliddery claims on lands grantit oot bi Langshanks. The claimant Edwart Balliol, born ab.1283, wis the son o King John Balliol an Isabel o Warwin, an noo turnt up at the coort o Ingland tae fleitch the Inglis king for uphaud, even tho Ingland an Scotland wis at peace. The deith o the guardian, Tamas Randal, on 20 July 1332 cuidna’a been mair untimeous. Edwart Balliol an his follaers landit in Fife fae ships an took on the split-new guardian, Donal erle o Mar. The war a shairp fecht wi airchers an langbowmen at Dupplin Muir, in Perthshire, whaur Donal wis slain wi mony o his host on 12 August. Edwart haed hisel crount king at Scoun on 24 September, but the Bruce pairty made Sir Andra Murray o Bothwell guardian in name o Dauvit. Sae Scotland noo haed the twa kings. Whan Sir Andra Murray wis taen presonar in October 1332, Lord Airchibald Dooglas wis appyntit in his steid an focht on. Bi the November King Edwart Balliol haed tae shift sooth tae Roxbra as his grup on Scotland sliddert. While at Roxbra he pit his seal tae twa letters awnin Edwart III o Ingland as his owerlord, hechti t sodgers for Ingland’s weirs ootland, an gied ower the shire o Berrick tae the croun o Ingland. Sae faur, the king o Ingland haed been a private pairt-takar but aince Balliol cam fleein ower the border in Dezember, efter a bicker wi the Bruce pairty at Annan – in his barries an wantin a sark – Edwart III claimed that the Scots haed lowsed on

Ingland’s mairches. It wis the excuse the Inglis king haed been waitin on, an he brak the treaty o peace. Forgettin the cannie tactics the Bruce haed learnt them, the Scots unner Airchibald Dooglas met Balliol an Edwart III at Halidon Hill by Berrick, in open field o weir. On 19 July 1333 the heich-heidit Scots gied up thair guid poseetion, an gaed ramstam at the inemy. Thay warna jist waured, but wis slauchtert wi the langbow. It is said that the arras fell like a plump o snaw, leain the Lord Airchibald amang the deid. Soon efter, Balliol held a pairlament at Scoun an forfeitit the follaers o Bruce, an in Februar 1334 he confirmed in anither pairlament that he haed grantit awa the hail soothland shires o Scotland – fae the Lothians tae Dumfries - til his ‘lord’ Edwart o Ingland. Only bairns daured cry Dauvit king, it wis said. King Dauvit, aged 10, wis noo sent awa tae Fraunce tae be a guest o his ally King Philip VI. Philip gied Dauvit, his wife Jean, an Dauvit’s sisters Maud an Magret, Gaillard castle whaur thay held a sma coort for Scots ootland. Back hame Dauvit’s follaers rose up. The twa leaders, John Randal erle o Moray, an Robert the Stewart, nevey o King Dauvit, wis baith jist bits o boys but thay gart Balliol flee for a time. The year efter, Sir Andra Murray o Bothwell took ower as guardian til he dee’d in 1338. The Scots siegit Perth – Balliol’s heidquarters – an it randert in 1339 aince Balliol haed fled. Robert the Stewart took ower the fecht an brocht his uncle Dauvit hame fae Fraunce in the simmer o 1341. Bi noo the Inglis king haed got hisel insnorled in the weirs wi Fraunce, leain Dauvit tae claim back his croun. But whan the Frainch king askit Dauvit for help, in 1346, the Scots king cuidna say na, an sae the Scots invadit Ingland. Jist by Durham the war a muckle fecht on 17 October 1346 atween King Dauvit an the lords o the north o Ingland. Dauvit took twa arras, an in the stramash an Inglis baron got a grup o him, but no afore Dauvit knockit a wheen o thon baron’s teeth oot. Chancy Davie, as the king wis efterwards kent, wis taen a presonar, tho his nevey the Stewart got back hame an wis soon at the heid o the king’s cooncil as lutenant o the kinrik. Edwart Balliol wis lowsed on Scotland in the hairst – his hinmaist shot at the croun – but Edwart o Ingland haed Dauvit in his hauns an thocht better tae treat wi him. The weirs haed been ill eneuch for Scotland, but a deidly smit noo oxert alang wi them. Stertin in the dowp-end o 1349, sodgers fae Ingland fechtin the Scots in the Borders gied this maist deidly smit – the Black Deith – tae thair inemies. It is jaloused nooadays that this wis a pneumonic plague, acause it spreid nae bother in caulder climates, an gaed fae body tae body, wi nae ratton in sicht. Efter the smitten’s bouk haed baggit, he or she dee’d in aboot twa days. Aince it haed dwyned awa in 1350, atween a quarter an a third o Scots fowk haed dee’d. It wad veesit Scotland again in 1361 an 1379, an mony mair times efter thae years. King Dauvit haed been safe ahin the waws o the Touer o Lunnon, an syne, in 1361, wad traivel til Aiberdeenshire tae escape thon ootbrek. Atween hauns he wis in Ingland whaur Edwart III proponed that shuid Dauvit will his croun til a son o Edwart’s, the Inglis king wad write -aff ony ransom claim an awn Scotland as a kinrik wi its ain richts, subject til Ingland as owerlord. Whit Dauvit thocht o this isna clear, but aince the Frainch, an Robert the Stewart, heard

aboot it, thay steert the fowk up for weir. In 1355 the Scots bate the Inglis at Nesbit Muir by Berrick. In turn, Edwart o Ingland brocht an airmy intae Scotland, in Februar 1356, an brunt his wey ben the Lothians, but he wis weary gettin. The same year he claucht King John o Fraunce an wantit King Dauvit, an Scotland, tae mak terms. Agin ony ploys comin aff, the Soothron king got Edwart Balliol tae sell his richts tae the Scots croun til him in 1356. Balliol hisel dee’d bairnless in Yorkshire, in 1364. Balliol haed haen a guid claim on the croun, but it wis the wey he gaed aboot it that scunnert maist Scots. Bi the Treaty o Berrick, gree’d on 3 October 1357, King Dauvit wis brocht hame for a 100,000 merks ransom tae be peyed ower ten year. The king’s factors noo stentit the lands, hooses, an guids o the kinrik, for tae raise the siller that the kinrik cuid ill afford, but in daein this gied the burgesses mair o a voice in the gaitherings o the estates an pairlaments. It wisna lang afore King Dauvit divertit a bittie siller, meant for ransom peyments, intil ither projects or intil his ain neive. His wife, Queen Jean, dee’d on 14 August 1362 at Hertford in Ingland an he took a second wife, Magret Drummond, the dochter o Sir Maucom Drummond. Thay war mairried oot o the bishop o Saunt Aundrae ’s hoose at Inchmurdoch, by Boarhills in Fife, on 20 Februar 1363. This same year the war an attemptit rising agin the king. Three lords, Robert the Stewart, Weelum erle o Dooglas, an Paitrik erle o Mairch, haed for the maist pairt run Scotland atween them while Dauvit wis awa in Ingland. Bi 1363 thay thocht the king fund less favour in them an that he wis spennin ower muckle o the siller meant for his ransom. His second mairrage, an the heizin o the Drummond faimly, micht’a been anither thing that fasht them. But Dauvit hired mair sodgers an pit doun the Stewart an his freens, giein his gallus nevey time in the jyle. In the wast o the kinrik anither lord haed, in Dauvit’s een, usurpit the king’s pouer. John o the Isles, heid o the MacDonell kinred, haed taen tae cawin hisel ri innse gall, a teetle that’s owerset in Scots as ‘king o the isles’. In the days o a mauchless Scots croun, John brocht guid lordship tae the Heilans an Isles whaur the king cuidna, even makkin treaties wi the Inglis, but Dauvit clearly didna want the faur wast gauin the gait it haed done afore the 1260’s. At the hinnerend, in 1369, Dauvit gaed north, dauntont, an syne peacified John, makkin it clear that in his een John wis a lord, an no his equal. Dauvit’s ettle at joukin oot his ranso m

peyments brocht aboot mair veesits til Ingland – an mair ploys. Aince mair it wis pit tae Dauvit, bi Edwart o Ingland, that gin the bairnless king wad lea his croun til Edwart or ane o his sons, Dauvit wad be freed o ony ransom. But as tae this ploy, weirs an nationheid haed come faur eneuch tae undae it. The Estates o Scotland forgaithert in 1364 an threapit on freedom: thay wad raither pey the king’s ransom nor thole an Inglis king as heir. The Scots noo played a pawkie gemm, gettin better ransom terms ilka time the Soothrons gaed tae weir wi Fraunce an haed tae keek ower thair shouders. As for King Dauvit, he wis maister an mair o his kinrik. In 1367 he stertit biggin a new castle at Embra alang wi a muckle touer that wis cryed efter him. It wis pairt fort an pairt kingly hoose wi his ain chaumers, financed aff the rowth o customs revenues he wis noo makkin. In Mairch 1370 the bairnless king divorced Queen Magret, an haed thochts o mairryin a third time. But on 22 Februar 1371 Dauvit dee’d aw a sudden, at his muckle touer hoose in Embra, aged nearly 47. He wis burried at Halyrood. Magret Drummond seen him oot an dee’d 31 Januar 1375. Gien scowth efter 1357 Dauvit shawed that he cuid be a strang king. He will aye bide in the shadda o his kenspeckle faither but in the hinnerend Dauvit left Scotland freestaunin – jist. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 11
Walcome tae pairt eleeven o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we le arn aboot the first twa Stewart kings, baith cryed Robert, an thair fykie faimly an kin. HOOSE O THE STEWART Robert II King Bleirie 1371-1390 Robert’s faither, Sir Walter the Heich Stewart, haed mairried on Robert’s mither, Princess Merjory, in 1315. Merjory wis the dochter o King Robert I the Bruce an Isabel o Mar. Robert the Stewart wis born at Paisley on 3 Mairch 1316, but the follaein year Merjory took a faw fae her horse an dee’d, while her man Sir Walter dee’d in 1327 whan Robert wis eleeven. The stoushie ower the croun gart the Scots grue, sae in 1315 Robert I passt a tailzie, an act makkin his brither Edwart Bruce his heir. Whan Edwart wis killt in 1318 a new tailzie made Robert the Stewart the heir, but efter Prince Dauvit Bruce wis born, Robert wis shiftit doun the line. Whan he wis aboot twinty, Robert met Leezabeth Muir an the twasome noo steyed up thegither as bidie-ins. Leezabeth wis ages wi Robert an wis the dochter o Sir Aidom Muir o Rowallan an Jenet Dennistoun o that ilk. Whither thay haed haunfastit isna clear but in 1347 thay speirt at the paip aboot a dispensation o mairrage. This wis grantit on 22 November. Robert an Leezabeth haed haen a screed o bairns but the paipal dispensation made thir bairns lawfae. Leezabeth dee’d at the fore-end o 1355 an Robert mairried on his second wife, Euphemie Ross, aboot 2 Mey the same year. She haed been born ab.1322 an wis the dochter o Hugh 4t erle o Ross an Magret Graham. The Lord Robert wis appearant heir tae the croun for maist o his days an the nobles haed lookit til him as a leader in the daurk an drublie days o the 1330s, an aince again while King Dauvit wis a presonar, but it wisna until his bairnless uncle dee’d that Robert won at the throne aged 55. He wis crount at Scoun on 26 Mairch 1371. Robert II wis blisst – or aiblins cursed – wi mony bairns. He faithert 21 bairns awthegither, an it wisna lang afore the heidmaist faimlies wis sib tae the Stewarts throu sindry mairrages. It is weel seen that Robert’s coort wis a Scots-speakin ane. He an his kinred noo heized up the staunin o the leid. The king wis a patron o John Barbour, airchdean o Aiberdeen, that wrate The Brus in the Scots leid ab.1375. Anither kenspeckle cheil, langage-wise, wis the king’s second son, Robert erle o Fife, an his guid-fowk in the Lennox, that gied oot chairters an ither bit screivings in Scots an-aw. Even intil Gaelic-speakin airts the Scots leid wis kent an whiles used for spellin oot wrutten Gaelic. In the faur north, in Orkney an Shetland, an aiblins Caitnes, Norn wis spoken yet, but Scots, a leid sib tae Norn, wis awready

kent the length o Orkney whaur the Sinclair faimly, sprung fae Lothian, held the croun o the causay. Acause o the Balliol weirs pairts o the mairches o Scotland, alang wi a curn castles, wis yet in the hauns o Inglis sodgers, an Robert wis wantin thae pairts o his kinrik back. The king played a cannie gemm, haudin tae the offeecial truce, but turnin a blin ee tae the daeings o the erles o Dooglas an Mairch whan thay lichtit on the mairches in 1377, an whan a Perth merchant, Andra Mercer, led a Frainch an Scots fleet tae herry the coast o easter Ingland. Robert wis for alliance wi Fraunce, follaein her heidship in ootland maiters. For instance, in 1378 the cardinals at Rome fell oot an electit twa paips contrair. Ane o the twa, Clement VII, flittit til Avignon in Fraunce an wis awned as the true paip bi Aragoun, Castile, Fraunce an Naples, an sae Scotland jyned Fraunce. Ingland, as the unfreen o Fraunce an Scotland, awned the Roman Paip Urban VI, alang wi pairts o Germany an Italy. This paipal schism, as it wis kent, wad teir Europe in twa for the neist forty year. Whan caws for weir cam oot o Ingland, in 1383, Robert renewed the alliance wi Chairles VI o Fraunce. Robert gree’d that he wadna renew the Inglis truce but wad insteid mak weir on Ingland. Chairles, for his pairt, hechtit new airmor an gowd for the Scots nobles an said he wad send 1,000 sodgers. Bi the dowp-end o 1384 the king’s eldest son, John erle o Carrick, alang wi Jeems erle o Dooglas, haed owergane the coort wi thair weirlike crack. It wis weel seen King Robert wis donnert gettin an cuidna cairry oot his duties, sae a cooncil wis held that made the king gie maist o his ordnar pouers tae John o Carrick as lutenant o the kinrik. It wis, in actual fact, a palace cowp. The follaein year the ammeral o Fraunce, John Vien, brocht an airmy tae Scotland, alang wi the airmor an gowd hechtit bi King Chairles. The Frainch an Scots strak at Ingland first an whan the Inglis invadit the Scots drave aw thair beasts oot the gait o them. The Frainch cuidna unnerstaun the Scots staunin back while the Inglis brunt thair hames, makkin a rare greeshoch o Embra, Dundee and Perth. But the Scots lauched this aff an tellt thair Frainch guests it wis nae bother tae fling thegither new hooses o heather an dub. It wis aince the stervin Inglis turnt hame, humphin baggage an spyles, that the Scots an Frainch bickert them the length o Penrith. An as tae the Scots fermers, the pridefae Frainch, used tae takkin whit thay

wantit fae the landward, fund them ower gallus. The Frainch endit up peyin for their meat efter a hunner o thair fowk wis murdert bi Scots peasants, an at the hinnerend, took the scunner an made their wa-gauin o Scotland. At the ootpassin o anither truce in 1388, Jeems erle o Dooglas, an Robert erle o Fife, led a twa-pranged invasion o Ingland. On the nicht o 5 August Dooglas waured the Inglis in a kenspeckle fecht at the Otter Burn but wis hisel hurtit tae the deith. The same year John o Carrick wis sair hurtit wi a horse kick an a general cooncil, cawed in the Dezember, made his brither Robert o Fife lutenant insteid. King Robert took nae pairt in this or ither weirlike maiters but did gie a hearin til ambassadors fae Fraunce an Ingland in the simmer o 1389, while he wis at Dumfaurlin, an gree’d that Scotland shuid be comprehendit in a general truce. The king dee'd 19 Aprile 1390 at Dundonal castle, Ayrshire, an wis burried at Scoun abbey. He wis 74 year auld. Queen Euphemie haed dee’d afore him in 1387. It is said that Robert earnt the by-name ‘bleirie’ on accoont o his aye bleirie-lookin een. Robert III The Cruikit 1390-1406 Born ab.1337, an bapteesed John, he wis the son o Robert II an Leezabeth Muir. In 1367 John mairried on Annabel Drummond. She wis born ab.1350 tae Sir John Drummond an Mary Montifex the heiress o Stobhaw, in Perthshire. At the age o aboot 34, in 1371, John becam the appearant heir o Scotland but bi 1384 he wis fasht at his auld faither an made alliance wi the Dooglas faimly. A commandin kick fae a horse pit the haims on his ambeetion in 1388 an syne he wis kent as the Cruikit. Twa year efter, in 1390, John hirpled tae the kingship, an wis crount 14 August 1390 at Scoun. Acause the Stewarts cuidna awn that John Balliol haed been king, John took the throne name o Robert III tae evite the style o John II. Hooanever, it wis Cruikit Robert’s kinred haed owerance o the kinrik, makkin or brekin peace as thay thocht guid. Ane brither, Alisaunder erle o Buchan, led a promisky life an brunt doun Elgin heich kirk efter the nebby bishop o Moray haed taen the pairt o the erle’s wife. Buchan’s uiss o caterans, or Heilan men o weir, as a strang airm, set the heather ableeze. An this brither wis justiciar o the north meant tae be. Anither brither, the cannie, politically gleg Robert erle o Fife, heldgauin as lutenant o the kinrik, gaitherin mony fowk in his aucht. It wis he, raither nor the king, that airtit policy in thae days. The brithers hung tae the alliance wi Fraunce sae lang as Ingland claimed owerlordship. In the wast Donal lord o the Isles haed become a maisterfae cheil but wis soukit in the troubles o the king’s brither, the erle o Buchan, in Moray. Donal’s kinsmen wis the leaders-aff o the ridshanks, hired men o weir, baith at hame an in Irland, an the king o Ingland noo treatit wi Donal as a ruler in his ain richt. King Robert an his brithers cuidna thole thir ploys an haed the Lord Donal cawed afore pairlament in 1398, an again the follaein year, whaur it seems he wis peacified. It wis in 1398 that the king inbrocht the style o duik tae Scotland, makkin his son Prince Dauvit duik o Rossay, while Robert o Fife wis made duik o Albany. Bi noo a cheil cryed Hendrie o Lancaster haed claucht the croun o Ingland but King Robert clesst him as a usurper. In 1399 Dauvit duik o Rossay haed been

appyntit lutenant o the kinrik, insteid o his uncle Albany, but he wis nae politeecian. Dauvit wis trystit tae the dochter o the erle o Mairch, but syne cawed-aff, gied her the dunt an wadna pey back her tocher. The erle o Mairch, ane o Scotland’s bonniest fechters, gaed radge an offert his allegiance til Hendrie o Ingland. In 1400, whan the Inglis invadit the length o Embra, Rossay steekit hisel ahin the yetts o Embra castle while his mither, Queen Annabel, heidit the crack wi the invaders. Albany brocht up an airmy but insteid o settin aboot the Inglis sut an waitit until thay turnt hame again. Queen Annabel dee’d in the hairst o 1401 while at Scoun an wis burried in Dumfaurlin. It wis noo that Albany made moves tae cowp his nevey fae pouer. Rossay haed proven hisel a pettit prince, daeless in govrenment or weir, sae in Januar 1402 Albany got Rossay’s demission throu the cooncil an haed hisel appynit lutenant aince mair . As lutenant Albany gied his nevey the jyle in his ain castle o Fauklan, an it wis thare, unner Albany’s tentie ee that Rossay dee’d no lang efter. The cooncil laid nae chairges but it is like Dauvit wis left tae sterve. The coort wis shed in twa pairties wi the king an Albany for peace wi Ingland but Airchibald erle o Dooglas heidit a weirlike pairty o nobles that didna want peace gettin in the wey o takkin back mairch lands or spyles. The weir wi Ingland cam til a heid in 1402 whan the ammeral o Scotland got tore intil Inglis shipping, but a muckle Scots airmy, heidit bi the erle o Dooglas, laidit doun wi spyles an ky wis bate sair-like at Homildon Hill on 14 September whan the deidly langbow caused a stramash amang the Scots, an thay brak an gied backs. Dooglas tint an ee an wis taen presonar alang wi Albany’s son Murdoch. Tho the weir didna end, Albany’s policy o peace noo cam tae the fore an the war nae mair campaigns unner King Robert. But Albany didna hae the hail coort in his aucht acause Hendrie Sinclair erle o Orkney an Sir Dauvit Fleeming becam the king’s heidmaist cooncillors in his hinmaist years. Thir twa lords noo warsled wi the pairty o Albany an the Dooglases. King Robert’s heir, his twal year auld son Prince Jeems, wis in the keeping o Fleeming an Sinclair. In Februar 1406 Fleeming wis killt bi Sir Jeems Dooglas. Appearinly the king wis feart for his son, an the ettles o Albany, an decidit tae send Jeems wi Sinclair tae Fraunce whaur Jeems cuid forder his education. A Danskin ship oot o Eastland wis chairtert but on 22 Mairch Inglis pirates claucht them aff Flambra Heid an sent Jeems tae the coort o Ingland. The news wis brocht tae King Robert an he dee'd no lang efter on 4 Aprile 1406 at Rossay castle, Isle o Buit, an wis burried at Paisley abbey. Screivars haes affen quotit a line that King Robert appearinly said aboot hisel, that he wis ‘the warst o kings an maist ill-aff o men’. For a king that cuidna yoke his nobles, an that’s brithers held his croun in contemption, it wis a fair but murnfae observe. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses Pairt 12
Walcome tae pairt twal o Scotland ’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we learn aboot Scotland unner the Albany faimly an King Jeems I. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) The Kinrik Unner The Albanies 1406-1424 Wi the deith o jaskit King Robert, in Aprile 1406, Scotland haed a laddie king that wisna jist oot the kintra, but wis keepit as a ‘guest’ at the coort o Ingland. A general cooncil o the kinrik, cawed at Perth in the Juin, declared that twal year auld Jeems wis king bi richt, but his uncle, Robert duik o Albany, wis appyntit govrenor o the kinrik atween hauns. Albany, aged aboot 66, wis a pawkie cheil, an didna gae oot his gait tae fesh back his nevey. Or lang he haed his ain seal strak, an rang like a king.Tae stert wi, Albany made a deal wi the erle o Dooglas an atween them thay haed the owerance o Scotland, but for the faur wast whaur Donal MacDonell wis maister. Albany haed the ongauin weir wi Ingland. The Inglis yet held the Scots strengths o Berrick, Fast, Jethart an Roxbra, an Albany’s ain son, Murdoch (1367-1425), haed been taen bi the Inglis at Homildon in 1402. The Dooglases wantit weir but Albany cryed birlie until 1409. In a cannie act, Albany gied the erle o Mairch a pardon an brocht him hame. The same year hame-aboot fowk claucht Jethart castle fae the Inglis an Albany sent a sqad o men tae caw it doun. The year efter, in 1410, ane o the erle o Mairch’s sons claucht Fast castle forby. Noo that Albany haed stealt a dint on the Inglis he made anither truce in 1411. In auld fernyears Albany is descrived as faur ben the Catholic kirk, aiblins no whit we micht jalouse fae sic a pawkie man. He haed Scotland’s first kent heretic brunt in 1407 an socht tae ding doun onything agley in the kirk. His intress in lare an releegion is patent eneuch fae the haun he haed in foondin Scotland’s first versity, at Saunt Aundraes. The weirs wi Ingland affen meant that the sates o lare thareawa wis shut aff tae Scots, while traivel tae the continent cuid be mischancy. A hantle professors at Saunt Aundraes haed stertit takkin on students in 1412 an Albany gied his uphaud til an ambassadry that brocht back a paipal bull makkin Saunt Aundraes a versity in 1413. Dootless the paipal schism left him thochtit an he took opeenions fae amang the heid kirkmen. Scotland haed follaed the paipacy heidit bi Paip Benedict at Avignon, while ithers follaed Rome. Hooanever, in 1414, the twa sides cam thegither an electit ae new paip cryed Mertin V, steidit in Rome, an Albany brocht Scotland ower til him in 1418.

At hame a muckle stoushie wis steert up ower the heid o claims on the erledom o Ross, makkin for Albany’s ae warst crisis. Whan Euphemie o Ross becam a nun, her auntie, Magret Lesslie, wife o Donal lord o the Isles, wis the neist heir. But Albany noo gart Euphemie name his ain son, John Stewart erle o Buchan, as her heir insteid. Donal cuidna get justice for the Albanies, sae the maiter cam tae straiks. Gauin ben Rosshire, Moray, an intil Aiberdeenshire, Donal herried thae lands wi an airmy drawn fae the Isles, Heilans an pairts o the North East, giein the Stewart kinred a rare fleg. Neist he lichtit on the lands o Alisaunder erle o Mar an threitent the toun o Aiberdeen. Mar noo gaithert men fae Angus an the Mearns, wi the burgesses o Aiberdeen heidit bi Provost Robert Dauvitson. The twa sides met in weir on 24 July 1411 at the Reid Harlaw, by Innerurie in the Garioch. The stramash gaed on until efter sundoun, an syne thay pairtit, leain Provost Dauvitson, an the heids o the MacLeans an Mackintoshes, amang the deid. But in drawin awa, Donal gied up his gains. Whiles presentit as a fecht atween Gael an Lawlander this wis naething but a stoushie atween menseless nobles, lowsed o kingly pouer. Albany wis noo threitent bi the auld inemy whan, in the hairst o 1416, the king o Ingland claimed owerlordship ower Scotland aince mair. The follaein year Albany an the erle o Dooglas siegit Berrick an Roxbra, the twa hinmaist strengths yet in the hauns o the Soothrons, but whan an Soothron airmy cam north thay gied backs. Weir wi Ingland noo gaed ootland. At the end o 1418 the Frainch wis in an affa wey acause the Inglis haed conquest the north o the kinrik an noo ettled at the Frainch croun itsel. The Frainch heir appearant, Chairles, sent an ambassadry tae the Scots coort an speirt for help. Albany cawed the cooncil an thay gree’d that 6,000 men – maistly lairds an younger sons - cuid list unner the erles o Buchan an Wigtoun, an fecht for Chairles. First landin in 1419, the Scots maistly siegit an took castles an ither strengths, an syne defait the Inglis at the Brig o Bauge on 22 Mairch 1421, whaur thay killt the brither o the Inglis king. At

the fore-end o 1424 Buchan brocht anither 6,500 men ower fae Scotland, tho whiles the Scots wis ower gallus in takkin whit thay wantit fae the peasants. The same year a Scots airmy took Vernoll in Normandy but wis thairsels brocht doun in bluidy defait at the same place on 17 August 1424. Aboot 4,000 Scots wis killt, amang them Buchan an Dooglas. Efter this, John Stewart o Dernley led the Scots in Fraunce, but thay haedna the maucht. Still an on, in brekin the Inglis mairch sooth, the Scots haed saved midland Fraunce fae conquest. In September 1420, aged aboot echty, appearinly at the hecht o his can, Robert duik o Albany dee’d. His eldest son, Murdoch, that haed been lows ed fae Ingland in 1416, an haed jyned his faither in the cooncil, wis noo appyntit the neist govrenor o the kinrik in name o King Jeems. Tradeetion threaps that Duik Murdoch wis a thowless ruler that cuidna yoke his ain sons, lat alane the ither nobles. But the Scots haed sairly fasht the Inglis in Fraunce, an Ingland noo crackit aboot King Jeems comin hame for the price o the Scots bidin awa fae Fraunce. In August 1423 the Scots pairlament forgaithert at Innerkeithin an gree’d tae send an ambassdry til Ingland. Jeems I The Lawgiear 1406-1437 Born 30 Dezember 1394 at Dumfaurlin, Fife, Jeems wis the younger son o Robert III an Annabel Drummond. In Mairch 1406 Jeems haed been capturt at sea bi the Inglis an wis held for the neist 18 year. He wis shiftit fae ane hoose til anither, wi a sma nummer o Scots gauin back an forrit wi haunling an news fae hame, but aye unner the tentie ee o the Inglis king as a uissfae hostage. In Januar 1412 Jeems wrate hame, tae the nobles, wi a plea that his uncle Albany haedna done eneuch tae lowse him, an aince again, in the simmer o 1417, addressin hisel tae the cooncil. In 1420 an 1421 Jeems wis taen ower tae Fraunce bi the king o Ingland as a wappon agin the Scots. Jeems wis askit tae caw on Scots haudin Frainch castles tae rander them up, an whan thay gied a deif lug, the Inglis hung capturt Scots as traitors tae their ain king. It wis a gleg ploy, but ane that didna wirk. Bi 1423, wi the Inglis king deid an a bairn on the throne, Scots ambassadors heidit sooth. It wis gree’d that Jeems wad be ransomed for 50,000 merks, or, as the Inglis cawed it, the price o his meat an chaumer, alang wi a truce atween the kinriks, 27 hostages for the ransom, an the mairrage o Jeems tae Jean o Somerside. Jean wis born ab.1408 an wis the dochter o John markiss o Somerside an his wife Magret Holland, makkin her sib tae the king o Ingland. It is said that Jeems haed fawen in love wi her, a seetiation that weel suitit the coort o Ingland. The twasome wis mairried oot the kirk o Southwark, in Lunnon, on 2 Februar 1424 an King Jeems, at lang last, haed his hamebringing in the Mairch. He wis crount at Scoun on 21 Mey 1424. Echteen year in Ingland haed got him on nettles an it wisna lang afore he set aboot his kinrik tae red oot whit he thocht wis wrang. In Mairch 1425 he haed Duik Murdoch an his faimly liftit, jyled, tried an heidit ding dang at Stirlin. The lands declared forfeit throu this bluidy act wis a walcome eik tae the king’s tuim chakkar. Deed, Jeems wis a grippy cheil bi nature, dootless the affcome o no haein muckle o his ain siller for mony a year. Fae 1429 he wadna pey ony mair

ransom an left the noble hostages in Ingland tae fend for thairsels. He stentit £26,000 - meant for the ransom - an endit up spennin hauf o the siller on his hisel an his projects. Wi mair croun lands in his hauns, an mair customs revenues an-aw, the king spent thoosands on biggin wark at Embra an, in parteeclar, his new castle an hoose at Lithgae. The war ither expenses sic as the new guns inbrocht fae Flaunders, an dear bocht ferlies for the king’s coort an faimly. This wis ane reason for the king tae haud mony pairlaments, sae the burgesses an lords cuid gree tae new stents. Jeems held ten pairlaments an three general cooncils awthegither, haed the auld laws set furth aince mair, an in 1426 enactit that the lairds shuid attend pairlaments. It wis for thir reasons that the screivar Bower gied Jeems the by-name o ‘the lawgiear’. The Easter Seas, Flaunders an Scandinaivie wis gey important tae Jeems for tred. The Scots haed foondit a staple port for Scots guids on the continent as faur back as 1347. At first this wis steidit in Birges in Flaunders, but flittit tae Middlebroch whan the poseetion o the Scots becam less siccar in the 1410s. Ower the neist fifty year the staple wad flit atween the twa touns. In 1423 Duik Murdoch haed brocht til an end a weir ower tred wi the coonty o Holland, while Jeems wantit tae evite weir in the 1420’s. The ruler o Flaunder s, that Scotland lippent on for muckle tred, wis the duik o Burgundy, an he wis allied wi Ingland until 1435. This pit King Jeems in a swither whan the Frainch speirt at him aboot makkin a new alliance an sennin ower sodgers tae fecht Ingland. Jeems gree’d a treaty, an hechtit his dochter Magret in mairrage tae the Frainch king’s son in 1428, but he hummed an hawed for the comin years. The Scots haed stertit sattlin alang the Easter Seas fae ab.1380, sennin guids back an forrit, sae it wis important that Jeems wis on guid terms wi Denmark an Norrowa, kinriks the Scots haed tae gae ben. The king made a new treaty wi Denmark-Norrowa in 1426, makkin uiss in the comin years o Bishop Tulloch an Weelum erle o Orkney as fowk kent at the coort o King Eric o Denmark-Norrowa. Back hame Jeems ill-haunled the lord o the Isles. In 1428 he cawed Lord Alisaunder til a gaithering at Innerness an haed him liftit, pittin a wheen o his follaers tae deith. Aince Alisaunder haed been lowsed, in 1429, it wis nae ferlie whan he heidit a rising agin the king, but wis defait in Lochaber an taen a presonar again. The king sent the erle o Mar tae peacify the Heilans in 1431 but whan Mar wis hisel defait, at Innerlochy, pairlament fleicht the king for peace. It wis weel seen that naebody but the region’s ain lord cuid command fowk richtly, an that King Jeems’s policy left the Heilans in a pauchle. He took the rue an noo set Alisaunder free. Jeems left hisel lookin menseless efter the Burgunds gied up the alliance wi Ingland in 1435. A lang switherer, Jeems noo chenged policy an made guid the treaty wi Fraunce. Thon year the Scots dung back an Inglis airmy at Piperden, in Berrickshire, a win that kittled the king. In 1436 he mairried his dochter Magret on the heir appearant o Fraunce, an siegit Berrick, a Scots castle in Soothron hauns. But he soon gied backs tae the Inglis airmy o relief. In weir the king haed tint face but, tae mak maiters waur, he an his cooncillors fasht ane word wi anither ower the heid o his taxes. A sma pucklie lords thocht guid tae rid

Scotland o a king that wis suspeecious o his nobles an greedy for lands an siller. The king haed in his aucht a hail screed o erledoms an wisna lairge wi patronage at the coort. On 21 Februar 1437 Graham o Kinpunt an Robert Stewart o Atholl, alang wi thair men bodin in fear o weir, got ingait tae the king at the Chairterhoose o Perth. Jeems took a fleg an ettled at makkin his escape throu a cundie, but the murderers got a grup, harled him back, an stickit the king tae deith. Jeems wis burried at the Chairterhoose kirk. Said tae be a brosey, cutty man, gien tae guid leevin, Jeems wis nanetheless a man o culture, skeely as a makar, an a hairpist forby. It is like he wis the first Scots king that haed his eemage pentit, tho the oreeginal wis tint langsyne. His weeda, Queen Jean, wad mairry her second man, Sir Jeems the Black Knicht o Lorn, in Juin 1439, an she dee’d on 15 July 1445 at Dunbar castle. She wis burried alang wi King Jeems in the Chairterhoose o Perth. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 13
Walcome tae pairt thirteen o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot King Jeems II, a young weirlike king, best kent for settin aboot the michty Dooglas faimly. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) Jeems II o the Fiery Face 1437-1460 Jeems an his twin, Alisaunder, wis born 16 October 1430 at Halyrood, Embra, an wis the sons o Jeems I an Jean o Somerside. Alisaunder dee’d no lang efter, le ain Jeems the ae son an heir. Throu the murder o his faither, in Februar 1437, sax year auld Jeems becam king. The war noo a sprauchle for pouer atween Queen Jean an Walter erle o Atholl, the cheil that haed steert for the king’s deith, but Jean haed uphaud fae Airchibald erle o Dooglas. The killers o her man wis huntit doun, an auld fernyears threaps that Atholl, the man that jaloused he cuid weir the croun, dee’d wi a rid hot croun o iron on his heid. Queen Jean thocht Scoun wis ower chancy, steidit as it wis by Perth, the place o the king’ s slauchter, sae she brak wi lang tradeetion an brocht her son til Halyrood, an haed him crount 25 Mairch 1437. Acause the king wis a bairn the noble cooncil gaithert in Mey an appyntit Airchibald erle o Dooglas as lutenant o the kinrik. The queen, an ootlin, noo tint ony pouer, but wis gien a pension an the keeping o the king’s person. Dooglas ruled until he dee’d wi a fever in Juin 1439, but his deith led til a time o drumlie politics. The same month Queen Jean wis mairried on her second man, Jeems Stewart the Black Knicht o Lorn, an stertit biggin up her ain pouer aince mair. But in the August the keeper o Stirlin castle, Sir Alisaunder Levingstoun o Callandar, that haed the keeping o the laddie king, aw a sudden liftit Queen Jean an her man. The chauncellor, Sir Weelum Crichton, yokit the mauchless cooncil an oxtert alang wi the cannie Levingstoun, an his freen Muckle Jeems Dooglas erle o Avondale, tae hae the owerance o Scotland. In September 1439, at a general cooncil in Stirlin, thir lords made the queen gie the king ower tae thaim. Muckle Jeems’s grand nevey wis Weelum erle o Doog las, son o the deid lutenant. Bi 1440 the young Dooglas wis stertin tae tak a haun in politics an wad’a been heidmaist cooncillor tae the king, grundit on his poseetion, but Muckle Jeems cuidna thole this. In November 1440, Erle Weelum, an his brither Dauvit, wis inveetit til a feast at Embra, alang wi King Jeems, aged ten, whan aw a sudden the brithers wis liftit for treason, harled fae the begrutten king, an baith heidit. Weelum wis aboot 17 an Dauvit 15. Even in thae days the killin o bits o

boys wis thocht ugsome an for this reason the feast haes been kent sensyne as ‘the Black Denner’. Muckle Jeems noo claimed the erledom an lands o his murdert nevey. Crichton, Dooglas, an Levingstoun, held the croun o the causay atween them, until, in the simmer o 1442, Dooglas an Levingstoun fell oot wi Crichton. On his pairt, Crichton socht freenship wi Jeems Kinnedy bishop o Saunt Aundraes, an throu him, wi Queen Jean. Whan Muckle Jeems dee’d, in Mairch 1443, his son Weelum becam erle o Dooglas an ettled at the dounfaw o the Crichton faimly, settin the heather ableeze the follaein year. In the hairst o 1444 the pawkie Dooglas an Levingstoun used the cooncil and king tae daunton ony unfreens throu declarin that King Jeems, noo aged 14, wis auld eneuch tae rule, jalousin thay wad hae the airtin o politics thair lane. The Crichton faimly wis miscawed traitors an the laddie king wis brocht tae the siege an faw o Meffen castle. Amang the pairt-takars o the Crichtons wis Bishop Kinnedy o Saunt Aundraes, a cheil that’s lands in Fife wis noo brunt an spylt, an the king’s mither, Queen Jean, siegit noo in her castle o Dunbar. Chauncellor Crichton held oot, siegit in Embra castle, but Queen Jean dee’d on 15 July 1445 an her castle randert. Her man, Sir Jeems Stewart, wis sent oot the kintra, but Chauncellor Crichton made a deal tae gie up Embra. Bi July 1445 the ceevil weir wis ower. The Levingstoun kinred fund its wey intil a puckle offices an poseetions. Sir Alisaunder wis justiciar, Jeems wis chaumerlain, while Robert wis comptroller haein the say ower the king’s siller. In 1449 thay an Dooglas made a treaty wi the duik o Burgundy that brocht tred richts tae the Scots in Flaunders, an a mairrage for King Jeems tae the duik’s grand niece, Mary o Gilder. Aged aboot 16 she wis the dochter o Arnold duik o Gilder an Katren o Cleave. The tocher o 60,000 crouns wis a walcome handsel. Jeems wis mairried on Mary at Halyrood on 3 July 1449. The 18 year auld king wis kent as ‘fiery face’ an wad’a made a kenspeckle feegur on accoont o the rid birth mark that covert the caur-side o his face. This is appearant in a penting o Jeems made bi a German knicht that met the king in Scotland the follaein year. It wis noo that the kingly callant, reared amang gallus, affen veecious lords, socht tae shaw his maucht an staun his lane. In September 1449 he haed the Levingstouns liftit an syne declared forfeit. He wisna efter bluid sae muckle as the siller for his queen’s income gree’d unnner the treaty wi Burgundy. But the affcome wis the dounfaw o the Levingstouns. The policy o Dooglas an Levingstoun haed been tae bigg up Scotland’s alliances wi fremmit kintras, pairtly wi an ee on tred, an pairtly agin the ongauin threit fae Ingland, an King Jeems held-gauin this gait. As a wey o makkin the alliances the king’s sisters wis mairried aff. The auldest, Magret, haed awready been mairried on Lewis o Fraunce, but dee’d ill -used in 1445. Isabella haed been mairried on Frauncis duik o Bertany in October 1442 but whan he dee’d in 1450 Jeems wantit her tae come hame sae he cuid mak a new mairrage, an siller for hisel . He haed never peyed Isabella’s tocher, sae fasht at her brither, she refused tae lea Bertany. Twa ither sisters, Eleanor an Jean, wis inveetit in 1445 tae the Frainch coort whaur thay bade the neist twa-three year. The

Frainch king, Chairles VII, noo haed a direct haun in trokin the mairrage o Eleanor wi his ally, Seegsmund airchduik o Austrich, in September 1448. It seems unsonsie Jean cuidna get a man, sae wis brocht hame. Years efter, in 1459, her brither mairried her on the erle o Morton. Sister Mary wis mairried in 1444 on Wolfart coont o Grandpre and lord o Vere in Zealand. Zealand wis gey important as the province that muckle Scots tred gaed ben. The youngest sister, Annabella, wis mairried on Lewis duik o Savoy in 1447 but syne wis brocht hame agin her will an her mairrage declared unlawfae, her brither King Jeems gettin 25,000 crouns rue-bargain in 1456. He wad use her again, in 1459, whan he mairried her aff til anither ally George Gordon maister o Huntly. At hame the michty Dooglas kinred, wi sae mony lands, offices an alliances in thair aucht, haed King Jeems thochtie. Erle Weelum’s auld inemy Chauncellor Crichton, an Bishop Trumell, stertit cheepin at the king’s lug. Baith Jeems an Dooglas haed claims on the erledom o Wigtoun, while Dooglas haed appearinly made a baund o alliance wi the erle o Crawfoord an John lord o the Isles. In Februar 1452 the erle attendit a denner wi the king at Stirlin castle whaur the king askit him tae gie up the baund. Whan the erle wadna, Jeems gaed gyte, pullt a knife, an stickit him. Sir Paitrik Gray noo took a pole aix an dung oot the erle’s harns while the lave o the king’s men jyned in the stickin, leain the deid erle wi 26 stangs. Syne the bluidy bouk wis cast oot a windae. It wis a scunnersome act but pairlament exonert the king, an noo he gaed tae weir wi the murdert erle’s hail faimly, the sae -cryed Black Dooglases. At first the twa sides banged awa brawly, in the simmer o 1452, but the king haedna maucht eneuch an cryed birlie. He an the new erle, Jeems, made a peace, but neither side wis aefauld. Dooglas’s ally, Crawfoord, haed awready been defait at Breichin in Mey 1452, an in Mairch 1455 the king, wi his new Frainch guns, strak again, siegin an cawin doun castles an ither hooses o strength. But it wis a puckle Border lairds, Johnston, Maxwell an Scott, that met in wi the erle o Dooglas’s brithers at Arkinholme by Langholm, on 1 Mey, that blootert the Dooglases as thay war humphin spyles. The king brocht siege guns doun tae the hinmaist Dooglas strength, Trief in Kirkoubrie, in the July, but it wis soon randert.

Tae the north Jeems haed maiters ootstaunin wi King Christiern I o DenmarkNorrowa. The Scots haed defautit on peyments tae Norrowa for the Waster Isles, owe unner the Treaty o Perth o 1266. But a stoushie wis steert up in the hairst o 1456 whan Bjorn Thorleifsson, govrenor o Iceland, wis blew intil Orkney on his wey tae Denmark wi his king’s rents. His ship wis claucht, the rents taen, an Thorleifsson jyled, at the fleitchin o the Scots. Ony ettles at talks wis pit-aff until 1459 whan the twa sides forgaithert in Fraunce wi King Chairles as owersman. King Jeems wantit a mairrage wi Denmark, the end tae claims for the peyment, an Shetland for a tocher. Christiern cuidna dae muckle aboot the peyments owe him. On the ither haun, a mairrage treaty wad’a been a facesaving wey oot. Sae things stood at the deith o Jeems, but the policy o the Scots taewards the Norlan Isles wis weel seen. Noo that Jeems haed murdert, an blootert, the Black Dooglases, the weirlike king turnt on the hinmaist lands usurpit bi Ingland: Berrick an Roxbra. The Inglis haed lichtit on Scotland back in October 1448 but haed been defait at the Sark in Annandale. In the simmer o 1455, an again in Februar 1457, Jeems siegit Berrick, but wi nae gain. In the second year he led a muckle raid throu norlan Ingland, spylin an cawin doun touers, while anither body o sodgers raidit the Isle o Man. In the simmer o 1460 Jeems led anither airmy agin Roxbra an seigit hit. The king haed a liking for the new bombards, or guns. Pairt o Mary o Gilder’s tocher haed been peyed in airms an wappons. Deed, Jeems haed brocht the muckle bombard Mons Meg ower fae Flaunders in 1457. At Roxbra on 3 August 1460, while the king wis staunin by ane o his canons, the wappon misgaed wi a flist that killt him. Jeems o the fiery face, an fiery nature, dee’ d as he haed rung. He wis 29 year auld. The Scots held forrit, took the castle, an haed it cawed doun aince an for aw, while the deid king wis taen an burried at his caufgrund o Halyrood.

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 14
Walcome tae pairt fourteen o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. Aince mair Scotland haed a laddie king, but whit an orra king Jeems III wad turn oot. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) Jeems III 1460-1488 Jeems wis born 10 July 1451 at Saunt Aundraes, in Fife, an wis the son o Jeems II an Mary o Gilder. His faither haed been killt wi the flist o a cannon, leain nine year auld Jeems as king. The ladd ie king’s mither, Queen Mary, pit herself at the heid o the kinrik an haed Jeems crount 10 August 1460 at Kelsae Abbey in the Borders. It wis a kenspeckle crouning for the airmy o Scotland haedna lang taen Roxbra, an sae the war a thrang o knichts, sodgers an follaers in-aboot. It wisna lang afore thay brak Wark castle an brocht hit at the yird an-aw. In Februar 1461 pairlament forgaithert an confirmed that Queen Mary haed the keeping o the king, an airtin o the govrenment, at the heid o a cooncil o nobles. Hooanever, Bishop Jeems Kinnedy o Saunt Aundraes won hame fae Fraunce in 1461 an pit hisel at the heid o the nobles that differt wi the queen’s policies. In parteeclar, Kinnedy wis for Fraunce while the queen wis for Burgundy in fremmit maiters. In Aprile 1461 the Frainch queen o Ingland, Magret o Anjou, turnt up at the coort o Scotland an speirt at Queen Mary aboot help, efter Ingland haed sliddert intae ceevil weir. Mary wad gie the king an queen o Ingland beild in Scotland for a twalmonth, but thay haed tae gie Berrick back tae Scotland. Queen Mary wis sweirt tae be soukit intil Ingland’s weir, but, in Januar 1463, the erle o Angus led an airmy tae help the Magret ane’s men at Anneik, while Mary o Gilder brocht her son King Jeems tae siege Norham castle in July. But It gaed agley, an Mary’s airmy gied backs til a Soothron airmy. At the same time, the Inglis usurper, Edwart IV, haed made a treaty in Februar 1462 wi the banisht erle o Dooglas, that’s faimly haed been blootert bi Jeems II, an wi John MacDonell lord o the Isles. The twa traitors gree’d that thay wad gie the Edwart ane uphaud in ony conquest o Scotland, haudin pairts o the kinrik as his vassals. The treaty wis, in coorse, haivers, but the ettle ahin it wis tae fash the Scots govrenment. Bi the hairst o 1463 Queen Mary wisna weel gettin, giein Bishop Kinnedy the scowth he socht for airtin the kinrik’s affairs, an whan Mary dee’d, at Embra on 1 Dezember 1463, aged aboot 30, pouer fell tae Bishop Kineddy his lane wi the king in the keeping o his brither Lord Gilbert Kinnedy at Stirlin castle. Queen Mary wis burried at Trinity College Kirk, in Embra, but whan thon wis cawed doun in the 1840’s her deidkist wis taen an burried at Halyrood abbey. Kinnedy took the rue for his uphaud o Magret o Anjou an in Juin 1464 made a truce wi Edwart IV, seen as the king o Fraunce wadna back Scotland. The bishop noo

took King Jeems a gang-roond Scotland in the simmer o 1464, takkin in Aiberdeen, Dundee an Innerness. But Kinnedy hisel wisna weel, an he dee’d on 24 Mey 1465 at Saunt Aundraes aged aboot 57. This wis the inlat for sleekit Lord Robert Boyd tae forder his ettles. On 9 July 1466, at the skailin o the chakkar audit, in Lithgae, 15 year auld King Jeems set oot for the hunt, but the Boyds turnt up an wheecht him awa til Embra. In October a weel staged pairlament wis held an King Jeems declared that Boyd haed actit on his say. Naebody seemed that fasht, until Boyd gaed ower faur in his ambeetion. In 1467 Lord Robert haed his son Tamas made erle o Arran an mairried him on King Jeems’s sister Mary. It is said that Jeems wis in a dr eidfae wey an gret at the waddin. Boyd noo haed hisel made chaumerlain forby. Amang the fendin for hisel, tho, Boyd did tak in haun the ootstaunin maiter o Norrowa. In 1468 ambassadors, comprehendin Tamas erle o Arran, an Bishop Tulloch o Orkney, gaed tae Denmark. In September, bi the Treaty o Copmanhaven, King Christiern I Audenburg o Denmark-Norrowa gree’d that the wad be nae mair peyments askit for the Waster Isles an that the twa kings wad be allies, yokit wi a mairrage atween Christiern’s dochter Magret, bi his wife Dorothy Hohenzollern o Brandenberry, an King Jeems. Pairt o Magret’s tocher wis tae be 60,000 florins. The war nae wey Christiern cuid pey this, sae Orkney wis pit in pawn atween hauns. In Mey 1469, whan he haedna come up wi ony mair siller, Shetland wis pit in pawn forby. The Dens king cuidna dae muckle either whan Weelum Sinclair, erle o Orkney, wadna pey him homage. In 1470 Weelum sellt his richts tae King Jeems, an Jeems wad annex the erledom o Orkney an lordship o Shetland tae the croun o Scotland in 1472. This mairrage wis the dounfaw o the Boyds. In Juin 1469 Lord Robert wis awa in Ingland, while his son Tamas, bringin Princess Magret fae Denmark, wis warned no tae get aff the ship aince he won hame. At the hinnerend the Boyds fled tae Birges in Flaunders an King Jeems, fasht at the wey thay haed dealt wi him, declared the faimly forfeit. Jeems, noo aged 18, wis mairried on Magret Audenburg 13 July 1469 at Halyrood. She wis aboot 13 year auld.

In Jeems III, the Scots soon fund thay haed an orra king wi a rare conceit o hisel, gauin bi novations that’s ettle wis tae heize the staunin o kingship ayont whit wis actual fact. Jeems spak in terms o his imperial croun, an clearly haed in mind his sibness wi the kingly hooses o Austrich, Burgundy an ithers. Fae this time dates the rare pentings o the king an queen, pentit bi the Fleeming Hugo Van der Goes, in a style unkent in Scotland fernyears. Bi the 1480’s Jeems wis makkin coins shawin his face three-quartert an weirin an imperial croun. It kittled the king tae mell wi the politics o his imperial kizzens. In 1471 he an Chairles the Gallus o Burgundy socht tae redd-up tred richts disputit atween Fleemings an Scots, an the follaein year Jeems hostit ambassadors o Denmark an Fraunce. But his nobles took a fleg at Jeems’s ploys tae conquest fremmit lands. Ane wis tae gie Lewis o Fraunce a haunder in the conquest o Bertany. Anither wis tae conquest the coonty o Saintonge, in Fraunce. In 1473 the king pit forrit his claim til his granfaither’s duikry o Gilder, but the estates o pairlament, wanrestie at the king’s ploys, hummed an hawed an didna vote Jeems the siller he wantit for tae pey sodgers. But, abuin awthing ither, it wis Jeems’s ettles at al liance wi Ingland that cawed his nobles aff thair stotter. Efter King Lewis o Fraunce lat Jeems doun, the king haedna muckle choice but tae treat wi Edwart IV o Ingland. The Inglis king wis gled tae speak aboot peace an gree’d that his dochter wad mairry Jeems’s son. A wheen nobles, tho, haed come tae haud tuithy opeenions o the king. Heidmaist amang them wis Airchibald Dooglas erle o Angus an the king’s ain brither, Alisaunder duik o Albany. Baith lords made profit oot o weir on the mairches, throu raids an political troke, an didna want peace gettin in the road. An it wisna for naething that Blin Harry’s Wallace first kythed in thae days. This bit screive wis meant tae steer Scots fowk agin Ingland. Mair nor aince John MacDonell lord o the Isles haed Jeems on a preenheid. In 1475 the king forfeitit him for dealin wi Ingland in years bygane, for takkin on the king’s pouers, an siegin Rossay castle. The king led airmies agin John in 1476, makkin uiss o George Gordon erle o Huntly, in the north, an Airchibald Campbell erle o Argyll, in the sooth. Poor John haedna the smeddum an haed tae gie hisel up. Left as lord o the Isles, John tint the erledom o Ross tae the king. In the comin years the Campbells an Gordons wad hae intae their auchts bodies an lands aince in the aucht o MacDonell. But waur, John’s natural son, Angus o Isla, pit hisel at the heid o his ain airmy an brocht weir tae the faimly. Like John o the Isles, Jeems haed his ain faimly troubles. In 1479 he haed an ootcast wi baith o his brithers. The elder ane, Albany, as warden o the mairches, haed steert up trouble for the king’s Inglis policy. Aw a sudden the king lichtit on Albany at Dunbar, but Albany fled tae Fraunce. The same year, the king haed his ither brither, John erle o Mar, liftit, but Mar haed dee’d bi 1480. Whit happent wi Mar naebody kens tae this day, but it didna lea the king lookin sakless. Bi noo the king o Ingland, wi naething tae shaw for peyin his dochter’s mairrage tocher, an the Scots on the mairches brekin the truce, took the pet wi Jeems an gaed tae weir. Bi 1481 the twa sides haed fleets settin the coasts o the ither alowe, but Scots tred took a heavy dunt. In 1482 Jeems’s brither Albany turnt up at the

coort o Ingland an wis set at the heid o an Inglis airmy, for tae come hame, turn Jeems aff the throne, an mak hisel the vassal king o Ingland. But whan Jeems gaithert his ain airmy, at Lauder, his thrawart hauf-uncles, Atholl an Buchan, alang wi Airchibald erle o Angus, took a grup o the king an hung twa-three o his servitors ower the brig. The king clippit the coinage, thay said, an fed swallen prices, his evil cooncillors held the laws in contemption, an whiles the king favoured lesser-born cheils. An anither thing, Saunt Aundraes haed been erectit an airchbishopry bi the paip in 1472. Rome wis faur-awa, but an airchbishop wis hame-aboot, an this fasht the ither bishops. Aw thir excuses wis gien bi nobles that felt thay cuidna lippen on the king ony mair. Albany fund the king, an his uncles, steekit ahin the yetts o Embra castle. The Inglis airmy, for aince, didna dae muckle skaith an thocht better tae tak Berrick back an lea the Scots tae thair lug-nippin an drumlie politics, efter the provost o Embra haed gree’ d tae pey the Soothron invaders aff. Naebody wad tak Albany on, sae he chenged sides an helpit his brither lowse hisel fae Atholl an Buchan, but Albany cuidna keep fae intrigues. In Juin 1483 he wis forfeitit but fled tae Fraunce whaur he wis killt at the rinks in 1485. Queen Magret haed taen a haun in dealin wi Albany, for tae fend for her son, but the king cuidna see by this an the twa never bade thegither again. The king peyed her veesits, but Magret bade at Stirlin alang wi her eldest son Jeems. She dee’d on 14 July 1486 an wis burried at Cambuskenneth Abbey, aged aboot 30. Aince mair the king jaloused he micht mak alliance, this time wi the new Inglis king, anither usurper, an aiblins mairry the auld king’s weeda, but ower mony nobles at hame wis feart for Jeems. Bi 1488 he haed taen sair agin the Hume faimly, an ithers like Airchibald o Angus, sae that thir lords made common cause as a pairty contrair the king. But, wi the king shawin favour til his younger son, Prince Jeems mislippent him an in Februar 1488 left tae jyne wi the pairty contrair. Twa airmies, baith steert throu suspeecion, tried tae mak terms, but neither side wis aefauld. On 10 Juin the king made a breenge at Stirlin tae tak Prince Jeems at the castle. The prince cam oot an thay blattert a wee at Stirlin Brig, afore he haed tae gie backs. But noo the rebel lords cam forrit, pit the prince at their heid, an the twa airmies focht at the sinderins o the Bannock an Sauchie burns on 11 Juin. In the middle o the stramash, dounby the Bannock Burn mill, King Jeems, cairryin the sword o Robert the Bruce, wis killt bi unkent bodies. His corp wis taen on 25 Juin an burried at Cambuskenneth Abbey, alangside Queen Magret. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 15
Walcome tae pairt fifteen o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot Jeems IV, a king that wis faurben the nation, but ower ready tae fecht. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) Jeems IV o the iron belt 1488-1513 Born on 17 Mairch 1473, he wis the elder o twa sons cryed Jeems, born tae Jeems III an Magret Audenburg. In thae days it wis a common eneuch custom for a faither tae hae twa or mair sons wi the same first name. For a lang time Jeems’s caufgrun wis unkent, but it is noo thocht tae’a been Halyrood. His brither, Jeems the younger, wis duik o Ross but in 1497 becam airchbishop o Saunt Aundraes an chauncellor o Scotland syne. The war a third brither, John, that becam erle o Mar. In the simmer o 1488, 15 year auld Jeems becam king efter his faither wis killt in the stramash at the Bannock Burn mill. Jist twa weeks efter the fecht Jeems wis crount at Scoun on 26 Juin 1488. Wis Jeems murnfae aboot his pairt in his faither’s deith? No lang efter takkin the throne the kingly callant peyed for masses for the sowel o his mither Magret, but it wisna til 1497 that he haed ony said for his faither. On the ither haun, auld fernyears tells us that Jeems took tae weirin an iron belt agin his skin tae chastify hisel, eikin new links whiles. Deed, the’r ae mention o the king’s iron belt in the lord thesaurar’s accoonts, in 1507, whaur it is appearant the belt wis happit in worset sae it wadna chaff his skin. As Jeems wis a haufling yet, the haed tae be nobles appyntit tae airt his policies. For a whilie the Heburn faimly, alang wi Airchibald erle o Angus, held the croun o the causay. In the pairlament held in October 1488 the Heburns an ithers dung doun the auld king’s freens an pairt -takars, sae that mony mislippent ane anither. It wisna muckle wunner that anither rising wis steert up in the simmer an hairst o 1489. Ae day Lord Forbes gaed ben Aiberdeen wi the deid king’s bluidy sark hingin fae his spear, an cawin for the murderers tae be fund. He wis jyned bi Alisaunder maister o Huntly an thay made thair wey sooth at the heid o an airmy. In the wast o Scotland Robert lord Lyle an John Stewart erle o the Lennox held Dumbertan castle agin the Heburn faction. It took twa shairp fechts in the October, ane at the Moss o Touch, an anither at Gartloaning by Aiberfyle, wi 16 year auld Jeems at the heid o the airmy, tae peacify fowk. It wis patent til awbody that the cuid be nae siccar government, but wi fowk belangin the auld king’s pairty, sae the king’s cooncil wis, bi 1490, waled fae amang aw pairties. For the neist five year the king lippent on a wheen nobles. Airchibald erle o Angus, an Weelum Elphinstoun bishop o Aiberdeen, wis kenspeckle. Angus, tho, cuid be a sleekit cheil an in 1491 the king learnt Angus haed been dealin wi Ingland ahin his back. But in 1493 the king made him chauncellor. Weelum

Elphinstoun wis made keeper o the privy seal an wad prove important in the admeenistration o the kinrik. His ettle wis for a versity tae be foondit at Aiberdeen tae bring lare tae the ignorant an barbarous fowk o the north, as he pit it tae the paip, an in 1495 got the paipal bull he wis efter. Scotland noo haed the three versities, at St Aundraes, Glesca, an Aiberdeen. Angus an Elphinstoun baith haed something in common. Baith thocht that treaties wi Fraunce wisna muckle uiss tae Scotland an wad raither the king made alliance wi Ingland. Hooanever, at the fore-end o the 1490’s Jeems haed tae tak tent tae mair domestic maiters, but here he fasht as muckle as he socht tae peacify. The real tickler for Jeems wis auld, mauchless John o the Isles that cuidna haunle his contermacious kinred ony mair. In 1476 John haed tint the erledom o Ross an syne the heidship o the faimly. John’s natural son, Angus, haed weired agin the king, but wis killt in the 1480’s. Efter his deith twa ither memmers o the kinred, Donal Gorme, an Alisaunder o Lochalsh, lowsed thairsels on the unfreens o the MacDonells, the king’s factors comprehendit. Bi 1493 Alisaunder o Lochalsh haed been acceptit as heid o the kinred bi the cooncil o the isles an haed lichtit on Innerness an Ross. King Jeems cuidna thole this an haed pairlament forfeit the lordship o the isles tae the croun in 1493, giein auld, mauchless John a pension. Thon simmer Jeems led a fleet intil Argyll whaur he soon fund a cheil ready tae gie him the haunder he wis seekin – John MacIan o Ardnamurchan. The year efter, MacIan killt Alisaunder o Lochalsh. Whan Sir John MacLean o Isla wis steert tae rise up, throu MacIan takkin pairt o Isla, it wis MacIan that huntit him doun wi Jethart justice. In the simmer o 1494, an again in the ware o 1495, King Jeems sailt intil Argyll tae daunton the heids o kin, makkin guid uiss o his leal MacIan. But whaur the war ae heidship in the Heilans an Isles afore 1493, noo the war mony, an affen the king wad use lutenants that haed thair ain ploys or feuds tae forder. The war that mony fechts an raids that the Gaels wad cry the neist 150 year ‘the time o spylage’. Bi 1495 Scotland wis aince mair important gettin, in the hing o pouer atween Fraunce an the Impire. The king’s cooncillors wantit a braw mairrage alliance for Jeems. The imperor-elect, Maximillian, wis giein uphaud til a pretender tae the throne o Ingland cryed Perkin Warbeck, an King Jeems took Warbeck on for his ain ends. Jeems sent an ambassadry tae Ferdinand an Isabella o Castile an Aragoun speirin efter ane o thair dochters. Ferdinand an Isabella wis a cute twasome, in

the middle o trokin wi Ingland for a mairrage wi King Hendrie an alliance agin the Frainch. Ferdinand an Isabella didna want Scotland makkin weir on Ingland for Fraunce, but haed nae dochter tae offer the Scots. Thay threapit on freenship, but jaloused thay cuid tak a lend o Jeems throu haudin his ambassadors back, playin for time til Ingland wis strange eneuch. But Jeems kent fine weel an in 1496 brocht the pretender Warbeck on a raid intil Ingland. In 1497 he led twathree mair raids an siegit Norham castle wi his muckle cannon Mons Meg that wis brocht doun fae Embra wi 100 warkmen tae redd the wey. The king o Ingland, wi risings at hame, cuid dae naething an in September 1497 gree’d a seeven year truce wi Scotland. Bi noo the king wis faurben his fowk. He haed an intress in mony airts an letters, like nae king afore, or at least mair records haes won ower tae tell us aboot him. For instance, he wis skeely in leids. His mither tongue wis Scots, but Jeems spak Frainch, Italiens an Spenish, Dutch, German an Latin forby. He is the hinmaist king we ken spak Gaelic, tho hoo versant he wis is anither maiter. The young king keepit a screed o fancy wifes – drawn fae amang the noble hooses – that gied him mony bairns. His first fancy wis Marion Boyd, neice o Airchibald erle o Angus, an mither o Jeems’s son Alisaunder, born in 1493. Je ems sent his son ootland for an education, the laddie haein Erasmus for a teacher. In 1504 the king haed Alisaunder made airchbishop o St Aundraes, aged 11, an chauncellor in 1510, aged 17. While Alisaunder wis a laddie his faither got tae admeenister the income o the airchbishopry. In 1496 Lord Drummond’s dochter Magret Drummond becam the king’s new fancy wife, follaed in 1498 bi Jenet Kinnedy. For the noble faimlies that hured thair dochters, the war offices an teetles tae be haed aff a king sae ‘slockent’. The king thocht naething tae deval, midwey throu a pilgrimage, tae veesit ane o thir weemen an see til hisel, as he did wi Jenet Kinnedy at Darnawa on his wey tae the shrine o St Duthac at Tain. The king haedna a wife but at the hinnerend, efter tuim-haundit troke wi Casteil an Aragoun, Fraunce an ither kinriks, the policy wis for peace wi Ingland throu a mairrage. In 1502 the twa kings gree’d a treaty o peace that wis meant tae aye haud-gauin, an Jeems wis mairried on 8 August 1503, at Halyrood, on Magret Tudor. Magret haed been born at Westmaister on 29 November 1489 an wis the dochter o Hendrie VII o Ingland an Leezabeth o York. Jeems wis aged 30 an Magret wis jist 13. Jeems’s policies ootland comprehendit the weirs atween his uncle, King John o Denmark, an Swaiden wi the airmed merchants o the toun o Luipkie in Germany. The Scots sent twa-three ships tae the Easter Seas tae gie King John a haunder in 1502 an in 1505 King Jeems actit as owersman atween King John an Swaiden. In 1507 Jeems’s ambassadry tae Luipkie brocht peace atween the toun an Denmark. In thae same years Jeems warsled wi the problems o his kizzen, Chairles duik o Gilder, that wis threitent wi Castile an the Impire, an pit Hendrie o Ingland aff jynin thir pouers agin Chairles. Bi 1507 the paip, Julius II, wis wantin Jeems on his side in his ploys agin Fraunce. He kent that Jeems wis allied wi the Frainch but wantit tae draw him awa sae that he cuid bigg up a league o states tae drive Fraunce oot o Italy. Thon year Julius sent ower Antonio

Inviziati wi a gift o a sword an hat he haed blisst. At a heich mass held in Halyrood kirk, in Aprile 1507, King Jeems wis gien the hat an sword afore a gaithering o the nobles an kirkmen. This sword becam pairt o the Honours o Scotland, the croun, sceptre an sword, an can be seen tae this day in Embra castle.King Jeems haed declared tae the paip his weesh tae heid a crusade tae the Haly Land an for aw the princes o Europe tae come thegither in peace, but thir princes wis a fashous thrang. Tho Jeems haed made peace wi Ingland in 1502 the twa sides cuidna keep the Borders fowk fae fechtin wi ane anither. Jeems threapit on Soothron pirates lichtin on, an spylin, Scots merchants at sea an-aw. But waur, his guid-faither, Hendrie VII, dee’d in 1509, an Ingland’s new king, Jeems’s guid-brither Hendrie VIII, wis an unco-guid 18 year auld that declared his ettle tae daunton the Frainch. In 1510 Paip Julius an King Lewis XII o Fraunce lowsed thair sodgers tae blatter ane anither ding dang. King Jeems noo sent Bishop Andra Forman ower tae Fraunce an Rome tae bring aboot peace, but naebody wad lend a lug. The follaein year Julius made a baund o alliance wi Spainie an Venice that Hendrie o Ingland jyned, howpin that Spainie wad help him conquest pairt o Fraunce. Jeems swithert a guid while, but the Inglis king drave Scotland intae the airms o Fraunce an a new treaty wis made in 1512. The weir cam in August 1513. Whan Ingland invadit Fraunce, Jeems wis askit tae mak a raid on Ingland, for tae draw her aff. Sae Jeems lichtit on the mairches o Ingland wi a thrang o an airmy. In fact, it is jaloused this wis the biggest Scots airmy that maircht on Soothron syle, haein intil’ t 12 erles an aboot 20 lords. Jeems took wi him 17 cannons that wantit 400 oxen tae pull them, an siegit Norham, Etal an Ford castles, takkin aw o them in days. Hooanever, Tamas erle o Surrey, commander o the Inglis airmy, maircht aboot Jeems an made tae tak up poseetion on the braes o Flodden in Northummerland. This wad’a pit the Inglis in the road o Jeems heidin hame. The king made a breenge on 9 September, sennin his ranks o spearmen dounhill, but it wis weet an gowsty weather, makkin the grund glabbert. The Scots brak ranks lattin the Inglis get in aboot, turnin a muckle fecht intil a muckle slauchter. Jeems, fechtin afore he gied his orders, an forleitin the guid grund, took an arra an sword straiks an wis killt fechtin like an ordnar sodger. The kings’s son Alisaunder, a bishop, twa abbots, nine erles, 14 lords, an 10,000 lairds, burgesses an peasants wis slain alang wi thair king. The bluidy, jaggit, scuddy bouk o the king, that haed the claes an guids riven fae it, wis taen intil Ingland whaur syne it wis burried at Richmont in Surrey. An sae the ring o King Jeems cam rattlin doun. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 16
Walcome tae pairt saxteen o Scotland‟s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt Jeems V is coortit in Europe an the stoushie ower releegion breks oot. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) Jeems V The Guidman o Ballengeich 1513-1542 Born 10 Aprile 1512, at Lithgae palace, in Wast Lothian, Jeems V wis the ae son o Jeems IV an Magret Tudor. Whan his faither wis killt at Flodden Jeems V becam king at a year an hauf auld. His mither, Queen Magret, cawed the nobles tae Stirlin castle for tae see the bairn crount at the king‟s chaipel on 21 September 1513. It wis kent as the „murnfae crouning‟ acause that mony fowk haedna been lang killt. Deed, Scotland wis in an affa steer an expectit Ingland tae invade ony time. The cooncil o Embra even stertit biggin a new wa roond the burgh, kent tae this day as the Flodden Wa. Gauin bi the deid king‟s will, Magret wis tae be tutrix, or guardian, tae the king, sae lang as she bade a weeda. This didna suit a puckle nobles heidit bi Chauncellor Bishop Jeems Beaton o Glesca an the erle o Arran. For thaim Magret wis the sister o the king that‟s airmy haed jist killt her man. In August 1514 Magret wis mairried in hidlins on Airchibald Dooglas erle o Angus, but aince the ithers o the cooncil fund oot, it wis her undaein. Noo that Magret wisna a weeda ony mair, she cuidna get heidin the cooncil an wis made tae demit. Her unfreens haed aye wantit John duik o Albany (1481-1536) tae be govrenor o the kinrik. John haed been born an reared in Fraunce an wis the kizzen, an appearant heir, o the laddie king. Albany won at Scotland an wis made govrenor on 10 July 1515. He kent fine that his maucht lippent on the keeping o the king. He askit Queen Magret tae gie Jeems ower, but fund her ahin the steekit yetts o Stirlin castle an refusin tae gie her son up. Albany brocht guns an sodgers, but poor Magret, awa tae hae a bairn an forleit wi her man Angus, haed tae rander the castle an haun ower her son. In the months efter this Magret jyned wi her man an thay fled intil Ingland. Lord Home, that haed helpit Magret, rose agin Albany but wis defait, gien the jyle an syne heidit for treason. Albany jaloused he haed peacified Scotland an gaed back tae Fraunce in Juin 1517 tae troke a mairrage for King Jeems. Scotland haed been comprehendit in a truce atween Fraunce an Ingland, an bi the Treaty o Rouen, gree‟d 26 August 1517, alliance wi Fraunce wis renewed an a dochter o the Frainch king hechtit King Jeems. But Frauncis I o Fraunce wis a luewarm freen. He wis sairly fasht wi the growin alliance atween Ingland an the Imperor Chairles V an socht weys tae fecht or mak in wi them turn aboot. Tae please Hendrie VIII o Ingland it suitit Frauncis tae keep Albany in Fraunce until November 1521. Whanever Ingland moved agin Fraunce, on behauf o Chairles V, it suitit Frauncis tae steer Scotland. Whan Albany haed gane ootland Queen

Magret an Angus cam back tae Scotland an steert up a stoushie, baith wi the Hamiltons, an amang thairsels. Bi 1519 Magret wantit a divorce acause Angus wis makkin ower free wi her siller, but maistly throu his keepin a fancy wife, Jenet Stewart o Traquair. Magret socht oot her auld unfreen Albany that‟s guid-sister haed mairried on the paip‟s nevey. A word in the paip‟s lug fae Albany an the queen dowriar o Scotland cuid mibby get her divorce. At hame the Dooglas an Hamilton faimlies focht for pouer. In Aprile 1520 the Dooglases drave the Hamiltons doun the Heich Gait o Embra in a clatter o blades kent sensyne as „cleanse the causay‟. The Scots wisna cantie wi King Frauncis sae thay gaed speirin at ither kings. This policy wis eneuch tae gie Frauncis a fleg, aince peace wi Ingland brak doun. In November 1521 Albany wis sent back tae Scotland agin weir, but Queen Magret, mindfae she wis a Soothron, clyped til her brither King Hendrie. Whan Albany maircht sooth in July 1522 the Scots nobles wadna gae ower the border. In October he gaed back tae Fraunce speirin for men an siller. Hendrie o Ingland brunt Kelsae an Jethart in Juin 1523, an in September Albany landit wi 6,000 Frainch sodgers. But his November campaign, in dreich, glaurie, weet weather endit in a hauf-hertit siege o Wark. Soon thay gied up an the Scots traipsed hame in the snaw scunnert that Fraunce wis takkin a lend o them. In the ware o 1524 Albany gaed aince mair tae Fraunce, but efter his wa-gauin Queen Magret an the erle o Arran cowpit Albany bi declarin the king o age. Thay brocht King Jeems, noo twal year auld, til Embra an haed him investit wi the croun, sword an sceptre on 26 July This weel suitit the king o Ingland that‟s policy wis aye tae shed the Scots fae the Frainch. He sent Angus back hame tae Magret howpin the twasome wad adhere an heid a pairty that wad see Scotland in Ingland‟s aucht. In 1525 the twa made a public shaw o makkin up, but Magret wis jist tholin Angus atween hauns. The same year, thanks til Albany, Magret got her divorce, but the king‟s mither clearly haedna the can for drumlie politics. It wis thocht wicelike tae gie the keeping o the king til a different noble ilk season o the year, Angus amang them, but aince it wis time tae mak the chenge in November 1525, Angus wadna gie the king up. The Dooglas kinred noo took ower mony offices in the king‟s name an tho twa attempts wis made tae rescue Jeems, at Melrose on 25 July an at Lithgae on 4 September 1526, the Dooglases bate thair faes in twa airmed fechts. At the hinnerend, Jeems haed tae lowse hisel fae thair grup, gettin awa ae nicht, either fae Embra or Stirlin, in Mey 1528, while maist o the Dooglases wis awa ithergaits. Aince he won at Stirlin he ootlawed the faimly an syne haed pairlament condemn them tae deith for treason, but Angus fled til Ingland in the November. King Jeems‟s bairnheid wis kenspeckle for the makkin o an orra politics whaurby the ordnar fecht atween Fraunce an Ingland becam insnorled wi releegion. In 1517 a German monk cryed Mertin Luther haed miscawed the paip for mony wrangs in the Catholic kirk. Nae man cuid get tae heeven throu the paip or priests, he threapit, or throu guid warks, but throu faith alane. Afore lang the war ither fowk, steert up, cawin for the kirk tae be reformed, for scriptures tae be in the vernacular or hamelt tongue, sae that fowk cuid better unnerstaun, an for an end tae the worship o eemages an saunts as distractions fae faith. Thir ideas

spreid braid Europe thanks tae the prenting press. Chepman an Millar, twa Embra merchants, haed been grantit the richt tae foond a press in Embra bi Jeems IV in 1507, but it wis unner Jeems V that prent word spreid. Mertin Luther‟s ideas fund thair wey intae Scotland bi wey o buiks inbrocht the ports o Dundee, Leith an Saunt Aundraes in parteeclar. The maun‟a been a stra ng tred this gait for pairlament haed tae pit throu an act in 1525 bannin Lutheran buiks fae Scotland. Syne, in 1528, a cheil cryed Paitrik Hamilton wis brunt for heresy at Saunt Aundraes, the steid whaur he dee‟d markit the day wi the letters o his name. He wis Scotland‟s first martyr.The year efter, the German princes that favoured Luther addresst thairsels tae the Imperor Chairles V as protesters, giein the releegious reformers a new name: Protestants. It wis intae this sliddery warld o politics an releegion that the 16 year auld Jeems stertit his personal ring. Tho scrimp o a guid education, Jeems wis skeely eneuch at music an cuid write Frainch forby his ain Scots leid. Whiles his mither haed spylt him, an he wis gien tae pettit acts. The young king wis a swank laddie, an eesome tae the ladies. In fact, he wis a radgie cheil, cawed bi some a huremaister, an the erle o Angus haed indulged the callant‟s intress in weemen tae distract him. For the lave o his days Jeems gaed oot mony a nicht wenchin wi twa-three companions, sae it wisna muckle wunner that he faithert a screed o bairns. The‟r a ferm by Stirlin castle cryed Ballengeich an whan Jeems gaed stravaigin he wad tell fowk that he met in wi he wis the guidman o Ballengeich, that is, the maister o the ferm. Jeems haed lang been coortit as a husband amang the kingly hooses o Europe. The deposed Dens king, Christiern, wis nearly sib an offert his twa dochters in the howp o a haunder fae Scotland tae tak back his throne. The Imperor Chairles V offert three o his kinsweemen tae brek Jeems‟s alliance wi Fraunce, but it wis

tae Fraunce that Jeems lookit for a wife unner the Treaty o Rouen. King Frauncis, wantin tae keep in wi Ingland, wadna offer his dochter, but suggestit Katren o Medici insteid. The paip wantit Katren tae mairry intae Fraunce, sae wis agin ony mairrage wi Scotland. Jeems, in turn, wrate tae Frauncis an tellt him whit braw offers he‟d haen fae the Imperor. Jeems wis in a bonnie poseetion. Tae mak up for Katren o Medici, the paip alloued a muckle tax on the kirk in Scotland in 1531. On the face o it, this wis tae pey professional judges in a College o Justice. Jeems peyed them, but maist o the siller wis alloued tae eik the king‟s ain coffers. The Imperor Chairles V haed made a treaty wi him in 1529 anent mercats in Flaunders an the Netherlands, an in 1532 sent Jeems the Order o the Gowden Fleece. In 1534 Hendrie VIII o Ingland made a treaty o peace an sent Jeems the Order o the Garten. But in 1536 it wis gree‟d Jeems wad mairry on Mary o Bourbon an King Frauncis sent him the Order o Saunt Mitchell. Jeems wis that blithe he haed his orders o chivalry carved ower the yett at Lithgae palace. But he wisna that blithe whan he gaed ower tae Fraunce in September 1536 an seen Mary o Bourbon. He gaed tae see Frauncis at Lyons an Pairis whaur it wis gree‟d that the king o Scots wad noo mairry insteid Magdallen Valois. She wis the dochter o Frauncis bi his wife Claude Valois an haed been born 10 August 1520 at Saunt German on Lay. Jeems an Magdallen wis mairried 1 Januar 1537 oot o Noterdames Heich Kirk, Pairis, but Magdallen wis a peely-wally lassie. She cam back tae Scotland wi Jeems in the Mey, but dee‟d 17 July 1537 at Halyrood Hoose. Jeems trokit a second mairrage, this time on Mary o Guise. The dochter o Claude I duik o Guise an Antoinette o Bourbon, she wis born 22 November 1515 at Bar-le-Duik in Loren an wis kin tae the king o Fraunce. Efter a proxy waddin, Mary wis brocht tae Scotland, landin at Crail, an she an Jeems wis mairried oot the heich kirk o Saunt Aundraes on 11 Juin 1538. As tae the king‟s mither, Magret, she haed mairried on her third man, Hendrie Stewart, back in Mairch 1526. She dee‟d at Meffen castle, Perthshire, on 20 November 1541 an wis burried in Perth. At the back-end o the 1530‟s Jeems haed come tae lippen ever mair on his kirkmen, sic as Cardinal Dauvit Beaton, tho he wisna feart tae threiten them tae win mair favours fae the paip. In the wast the MacDonells staw a dint on the Campbells an King Jeems gied commission til Alisaunder o Isla in the Sooth Isles insteid. The wast wis maistly lown but for the rising o Donal Gorm in 1539. Atween Mey an August 1540 Jeems hisel sailt roond the wast wi 12 ships, liftin heids o kin as he gaed. He spent time in Orkney whaur the haed lang been trouble atween Lady Magret Sinclair‟s kin an Jeems Sinclair o Brecks. Deed, the twa sides haed focht at Summerdale in 1528 an Brecks, the winner, haed gane on tae Shetland whaur he hung the lawman an ithers. In 1539 Lord Weelum Sinclair an Edwart Sinclair, brither o Brecks, gree‟d a baund o freenship, but in 1540 King Jeems gied the tack o Orkney til his favourite, Oliver Sinclair, abolisht the office o lawman an set up a Scots coort insteid o a Norse ane. But Norse an Scots law wad baith haud-gauin, allouin sleekit cheils tae tak a lend o whitever ane best fittit thair ain ends. Alang the mairches o Scotland King Jeems held justice coorts, dealin wi faimlies sic as the Airmstrangs, an for a while‟s time the reivers wis dauntont.

Bi 1541 Fraunce an the Impire wis aw oot. The king o Ingland, excommunicatit an feart for invasion, lowsed an airmy o 3,000 on Scotland. But it wis met bi the erle o Huntly an blootert on 24 August 1542 at Haddon Rig by Kelsae. In October Jeems gaithert an airmy at Lauder but the war an affa Scots tore in twa wi releegious an ither maiters. In truth, Ingland an Scotland wis pusht intil a weir bi Fraunce, the Impire, an ill dreid o the ither. The king fell ill syne an wisna wi his airmy whan it gied backs an skailt on the hauchs o the Solway Moss, on the border wi Ingland, on 24 November. Some 1,200 wis taen presonar bi the Inglis, mony gien ower athoot a fecht. Jeems, awready no weel, heard the ugsome news an took til his bed at Fauklan. Thare he wis tellt the queen haed gien birth til a dochter an he cam awa wi the weel-wordit quote “It cam wi a lass, it will gang wi a lass”, meanin that the croun haed come tae the Stewarts throu a wumman, Merjorie Bruce, an wad be tint tae them throu anither, Jeems‟s dochter . He lay wi his face turnt tae the wa, whiles laucht, an at the hinnerend kisst his haun tae Cardinal Beaton an the ithers by his bed, an dee'd on 14 Dezember 1542. He wis 30 year auld. No lang efter he wis taen an burried at Halyrood. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 17
Walcome tae pairt seeventeen o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. Queen Mary is ane o the maist weel kent – an maist controvertit – rulers o Scotland. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) Mary I 1542-1567 Born 7 Dezember 1542 in Lithgae palace, Wast Lothian, she wis the dochter an ae lawfae heir o Jeems V an Mary o Guise. Mary becam queen at jist sax days auld. On 3 Januar 1543 Jeems Hamilton erle o Arran (ab.1516-1575), near o kin tae Mary, wis made govrenor o the kinrik. The Inglis king, Hendrie VIII, noo pit forrit his ploy tae hae Mary mairried on his son an throu the lassie rule Scotland. Arran cuid be a sapsie. Offert Hendrie’s dochter Leezabeth for his son, or hints or mair weir, he gied in til Hendrie’s fleitchin. Bi the Treaties o Grenidge gree’d on 1 July 1543 Mary wad mairry the Soothron prince, but the Inglis king demandit the Scots brek wi Fraunce an send Mary til Ingland. The queen dowriar Mary o Guise an Cardinal Dauvit Beaton, the heids o the Frainch pairty, noo brocht Arran ower tae thair side an wee Queen Mary wis crount 9 September 1543, at Stirlin castle, tae mak a pynt tae the Inglis aboot sovereignty. In the Dezember pairlament elided the treaty on the grunds that the Inglis haed claucht Scots shipping. It wis bad eneuch that Hendrie VIII jaloused hisel anither Langshanks, but fae takkin a ding tae the harns, in 1536, he becam an ill-kindit tirran that slauchtert his ain folk. Sae he didna swither tae slauchter Scotland’s fowk an-aw. In Mey 1544 the Inglis king lowsed a veecious invasion on Scotland, for tae gie the Scots thair heids in thair hauns. Leith, Embra an Halyrood wis set alowe, an syne the burghs o Dunbar, Haidintoun an ithers. The Inglis took Jethart an Kelsae sae Arran gaed tae the mairches an on 17 Februar 1545 vankisht the Inglis at the fecht o Ancrum Muir. But in September 1545 the Inglis cam back wi anither airmy. The erle o Hertford noo brunt Drybra, Kelsae, Melrose an Jethart an waur, the crop o 1545 wis hasht at the hairst, leain the fowk scant o victuals. The Hendrie ane sent Protestant preachers, sic as George Wishart, intae Scotland, tae steer up ony reformers that micht favour Ingland. Awready the queen’s cooncil wis fleggit wi ballants, prose warks an letters that disputit heids o the Bible. Wishart wis brunt for heresy at Saunt Aundraes bi Cardinal Beaton on 1 Mairch 1546. But on 29 Mey Norman Lesslie, son o the erle o Rothes, alang wi his follaers, got ingait tae Saunt Aundraes castle, brak intae Beaton’s chaumer, an stickit him tae deith. The murderers took the castle an held it agin Arran’s siege until July 1547 whan a fleet o Frainch galleys kythed, seigit an took the castle. The murderers, wi thair preacher John Knox, wis sent tae the galleys. Hendrie o Ingland haed got his ally, Imperor Chairles, tae declare weir agin Scotland in 1544, but Chairles soon took the rue at the skaith Scots men o weir

did tae his shipping. In parteeclar, the weir sairly fasht the fowk o the Laich Kintras that’s tred lippent on guids fae Scotland. Ower mony Scots merchants wis makkin a profit oot o takkin Dutch ships. Hendrie VIII haed dee’d but the weir gaed on. In September 1547 the Inglis invadit unner the duik o Somerside, but an airmy unner Arran, Angus an Huntly wis defait at Pinkie Cleuch, by Inneresk, on 10 September. Huntly wis capturt an whan askit whit he thocht o the mairrage ploy, he said he haed nae liking for Ingland’s ‘rauch wenching’. Inglis ships capturt Brochty castle by Dundee an in Februar 1548 the burgh o Haidintoun. It wis Ingland’s ettle noo tae haud Scotland doun throu capturt strengths sae Scotland wis driven intae the airms o Fraunce. King Hendrie II o Fraunce offert help, as lang as Queen Mary wis mairried on his son Frauncis insteid. Frauncis wis Hendrie’s son bi Katren o Medici, born on 19 Januar 1544. Bi the Treaty o Haidintoun on 7 July 1548 Mary wis sent tae be reared up at the Frainch coort. Wi a Frainch airmy noo in Scotland, the weir turnt agin Ingland. In September 1549 thay forleit the heidquarters at Haidintoun an gree’d tae peace in 1550. The same year Imperor Chairles gree’d peace wi Scotland on behauf o the Dutch touns. In November 1548 Queen Mary haed been sent tae bide in Fraunce. King Hendrie wis fasht that she kent nae Frainch an brocht in servants tae learn her the leid. In fact, she learnt Greek, Italiens, Latin, an Spenish, an wi her ain fowk spak Scots. Her mither, Mary o Guise, cam ower tae Fraunce in 1550 an bade a year. She wis the heidmaist advocate for the Frainch alliance an in Aprile 1554 took ower fae Arran as govrenor, efter a hantle luifs haed been creisht. Frainch policy wis weel seen. Scotland wad be tae Fraunce whit the Netherlands wis tae Spainie. Bi the mid-1550s, some Frainch haed been appyntit tae kenspeckle poseetions, Dosell, the Frainch ambassador, haed an undue say ower political maiters, while Frainch sodgers held Blackness, Dunbar an Leith. Bi 1557 Mary o Guise wis wantin taxes tae pey for sodgers an bigg new forts. Whan Hendrie o Fraunce gaed tae weir wi Spainie the same year he wantit Scotland tae mak weir on Ingland that’s queen, Mary, wis mairried tae Philip o Spainie. The Scots nobles wad hae nane o it. Noo the ordnar fowk haed taen tae cawin the Frainch for awthing. The Protestant lords, noo cryin thairsels the Lords o the Congregation, cam oot in favour o preachers that haed foondit congregations alang the east coast. Whan Mary o Guise tried tae daunton them she jist steert fowk agin Frainch an Catholic rule. On 24t Aprile 1558 Queen Mary an Frauncis wis mairried oot Noterdames Heich Kirk, Pairis. Frauncis wis 14 year auld, while Mary wis 15. In hidlins Mary signed a deal whaurby she left Scotland tae the Frainch croun, gin she dee’d athoot bairns. No lang efter, the twasome took-on the airms an teetle o Ingland on the grunds that Leezabeth o Ingland wis born oot o lawfae mairrage. In Mey o 1559 Protestant preachers in Scotland gied a deif lug whan summoned afore the cooncil. Noo heidit bi the erle o Arran an Mary’s hauf brither Lord Jeems Stewart, thay gaithert an airmy an blattert wi the Frainch sodgers in Scotland. In July, efter makkin peace wi Spainie, King Hendrie o Fraunce wis ridin in the rink whan he took a skelf tae the ee an syne dee’d in commandin pain. This made Frauncis an Mary king an queen o Fraunce. In October the

Lords o the Congregation declared the demission o Mary o Guise fae office but haed tae mak a contract wi the Inglis at Berrick on 27 Februar 1560 for the airms tae uphaud the ‘freedom’ o the kinrik. A sma Inglis fleet lichtit on the coast an in the Mairch an Inglis airmy cam the length o Embra an siegit the Frainch in Leith. But whit chenged awthing wis the deith o Mary o Guise in Embra castle on the nicht o 11 Juin, fae a disease o the hert, aged 44. Laid oot in Saunt Magret’s chaipel it wisna until Mairch 1561 that her bouk wis taen tae Fraunce an burried at Rheims. The Treaty o Embra, gree’d on 6 July 1560, providit that baith the Frainch an Inglis lea Scotland, that a pairlament be held, an Frauncis an Mary gie up teetle til Ingland. The pairlament held in August cryed doun the authority o the paip, brak fae Rome, made Catholic mass unlawfae, an took-on a Calvinist Confession o Faith. Unlike Ingland, whaur the brek fae Rome wis done fae the tap doun, in Scotland the brek wis made athoot the queen. Mary wisna lang queen o Fraunce for her man Frauncis II dee’ d on 5 Dezember 1560 whan his harns took attery throu a bad lug. He wis jist 16. The Lord Jeems Stewart heidit the nobles that noo askit Mary tae come hame, sae lang as she toleratit the new releegion. This wis the kinrik Mary cam hame til in August 1561. Whan she tried tae hear mass at Halyrood it caused a sma stoushie an Lord Jeems haed tae staun at the door tae turn the steerars awa. Syne Mary gied the gallus preacher John Knox a hearin at the palace. She wisna used tae raucle langage an the tryst left her begrutten, but Mary set oot tae maister her land. In 1562 she gied the erledom o Moray til her brither Lord Jeems, but George Gordon erle o Huntly haed its estates an income unner his admeenistration an wadna gie them up. Huntly wis lord ower the heidmaist Catholic faimly, wi thoosands o men in his aucht, an he thocht the queen wisna daein eneuch tae keep the faith. His son, Sir John Gordon, wis a braisent cheil that thocht he didna hae tae answer for his feuds. The queen cam north til Innerness whaur the Gordon keeper wadna lat her ben the castle until Huntly sent word. Sir John Gordon haed gaithert follaers north o Aiberdeen, bodin in fear o weir, an act that left the queen beelin. Whan she gaed til Aiberdeen Huntly

made tae mairch sooth. Lord Jeems an Weelum Maitland o Lethington led an airmy oot the toun an focht Huntly at Corrichie on 28 October. Huntly wis taen presonar but while his horse wis led forrit he took a shock an drappit deid tae the grund. Thay brocht his corp til Embra, whaur stood up in its deidkist, in the middle o the pairlament, haed sentence o forfeiture passt ower it. Queen Mary wis scunnert syne at the ugsome sicht o a fouterin heidsman takkin the heid aff Sir John Gordon. Jeems erle o Moray wis noo the queen’s ae best cooncillor an for the neist twa year helpit her airt policy, but Mary’s search for a new man threitent Moray’s poseetion. The coorts o Austrich, Denmark, Fraunce, Spainie an Swaiden aw pit in for her haun, but at the hinnerend she fell for Hendrie Stewart lord Dernley. The eldest son o Mattha Stewart 4t erle o the Lennox an Magret Dooglas, he haed been born 7 Dezember 1545 in Ingland. Throu his mither, Dernley haed a claim on the throne o Ingland, like Mary. The twa war mairried oot o Halyrood on 29 July 1565 but Moray led a rising agin the queen in the August an Queen Mary haed tae chase him aboot til Moray fled intil Ingland. Bi the back-end o 1565 tho, Mary haed fund oot ower late the nature o the cheil she haed mairried. He wis pettit, cuidna be fasht wi maiters o state, bade awa fae cooncil, an waur, for the queen’s guid name, gaed drinkin an hurein at nicht in Embra. She lippent mair nor ever on men sic as Jeems Heburn erle o Bothwell, Lord Home, an her Italiens secretar Davie Riccio. The causay clash haed it that the queen wis ower freenly wi Maister Riccio, a cheil that Dernley thocht haed usurpit his place. The queen wis awa tae forfeit Moray an his pairt-takars at her neist pairlament sae thay collogued wi Dernley tae dae awa wi Riccio, pardon Moray, an gie Dernley the croun. On the nicht o 9 Mairch 1566, while the queen wis takkin her supper in Halyrood, Dernley, alang wi Paitrik lord Ruthven an the follaers o Jeems Dooglas erle o Morton, burstit in, cowpin chairs an buirds, an stickit the greetin Riccio in front o Mary an her ladies afore flingin his bluidy corp doun the stair. An the queen weel gane wi her bairn an-aw. Thir lords thocht tae hae owerance o Scotland throu Dernley but Mary threapit thay wad dae awa wi him. Sae the twa escapit fae Halyrood an the lords fled til Ingland. The queen cam back til Embra an thare, in a sma chaumer in the castle, gied birth til a son cryed Jeems on 18 Juin 1566. She thocht tae brek the maucht o the rebel lords an gied her brither Moray a pardon. Dernley wisna muckle uiss til her an bi the end o 1566 took cooncil fae Moray, an ithers, anent the best weys o endin her mairrage. A wheen o drumlie lords, Bothwell, Morton, an Moray, jaloused it wad be better tae kill Dernley, the man that haed betrayed them. On the nicht o 10

Februar 1567 Dernley’s ludgings at Kirk o Field, in Embra, wis blawn up an Dernley fund deid in the gairden. Historians jalouses that Morton’s men smoored Dernley while he tried tae get awa. A wheen o clavers wis noo spreid that Bothwell haed cairried oot the deed wi Mary’s ken. In Aprile, whan Mary wis traivelin fae Stirlin til Embra, Bothwell kythed wi his men an took her, mony said wheecht agin her will, tae Dunbar. Mary noo stammygastert awbody bi mairryin on Bothwell, at Halyrood, on 15 Mey 1567. Mary’s new man wis aged aboot 31, an wis the son o Paitrik the fair erle o Bothwell an Agnes Sinclair. Mony nobles unner Moray took up airms but whan thay met at Carberry on 15 Juin 1567 Mary’s airmy stertit tae traipse hame. Efter seein Bothwell aff the field she randert an wis brocht at the hinnerend tae the island castle o Lochleven. Here on 24 July 1567 she wis made tae demit the croun in favour o her son an Moray wis proclaimed govrenor on 22 August. Moray’s hauf brither Sir Weelum Dooglas held Mary a presonar, but his brither Sir George Dooglas fell for Mary an he, an a kizzen Wullie Dooglas, helpit Mary get awa ae nicht, rowin her ower the loch tae freens an freedom. She raised men an focht Moray at Langside by Glesca on 13 Mey 1568 whaur she wis defait, an syne fled til Ingland. Leezabeth o Ingland swithert ower whit tae dae wi her ‘guest’ for the neist 19 year. Mary wis at the heid o ilka Catholic plot agin the Leezabeth ane until tried an heidit on 8 Februar 1587 at Fotheringhay castle, aged 44. She wis burried in Westmaister Abbey, Lunnon. Her man Bothwell haed dee’d years afore, on 14 Aprile 1578, in the jyle o Dragsholm castle, Denmark. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 18
Walcome tae pairt echteen o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we lea rn aboot the Scots king that becam the first ruler ower the hail Breetish Isles. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) Jemmie VI 1567-1625 Born 19 Juin 1566 in Embra castle he wis the son o Queen Mary an Hendrie lord Dernley. Alane o the king Jeemses he haes aye been kent bi the couthy form o the name Jemmie. Efter his mither haed demitit, Jemmie wis crount on 29 July 1567 at the kirk o the Haly Rood in Stirlin. It wis a dreich ceremony whaur John Knox preacht an mony lords bade awa. Jem mie’s uncle, Jeems erle o Moray, ruled in the bairn’s name as govrenor, but aince Queen Mary escapit in 1568 Scotland shed in twa pairties. The uphauders o the bairn king – cryed the King’s Pairty – and thaim that wantit Mary back on the throne – the Queen’s Pairty - noo set aboot ane anither. The Hamiltons, that heidit the Queen’s Pairty, regairdit the rule o the kinrik as richtly belangin thaim. On 23 Januar 1570 while Moray wis gauin ben Lithgae ane o the Hamiltons kythed at a windae an shot him deid. Jeems Dooglas erle o Morton noo heidit the King’s Pairty but haed tae seek help fae Ingland tae gie the Hamiltons an thair freens a paikin. Twa Soothron airmies, in Aprile an Mey 1570, brunt the Borders, brunt the toun o Hamilton, an syne helpit siege the castle o Dumbertan whaur Airchbishop John Hamilton wis. Mattha Stewart erle o the Lennox haed come north wi the Inglis an wis appyntit govrenor o the kinrik in the July. The twa sides cryed birlie for a while’s time, but in Aprile 1571 , whan Dumbertan castle wis taen, Airchbishop Hamilton wis hung. The King’s Pairty cawed a pairlament in Embra in Mey 1571 but haed tae jouk for the guns lowsin on them fae the castle o Embra held bi Sir Weelum Kirkcaudy o Grange on behauf o Queen Mary. A month efter, the Queen’s Pairty held thair ain pairlament. In August whan the King’s Pairty forgaithert for anither pairlament, this time in Stirlin, thay brocht alang the five year auld king weirin a split-new croun, but on the nicht o 4 September Grange kythed wi sodgers an in the follaein stramash Lennox wis shot an killt. The day efter, John Erskine erle o Mar wis made govrenor but he lastit a year an dee’d on 28 October 1572. The King’s Pairty noo electit the erle o Morton as govrenor on 24 November. A screed o govrenors haed rung ding-dang in a kintra shed agin itsel but Morton noo tried tae win ower a wheen lords. In Februar 1573 in a gaithering at Perth, kent as the Peacifying, the kin an freens o Hamilton an the erle o Huntly gree’d tae awn Morton an Jemmie VI as lang as ony law plea agin them wis drappit an thair lands restored. But Embra castle held oot unner Grange. Morton brocht the Inglis in aince mair an siegit the castle in Mey 1573. For ten days the guns dung the waws til it randert an Grange wis taen, tried, an hung. Bi the simmer o 1573 the ceevil weir wis ower.

Morton kent his poseetion wis a sliddery ane sae haed tae lippen on Leezabeth o Ingland. In 1574 the preacher Andra Melville (1545-1622) won hame. He threapit the kirk shuid hae a say on state maiters, but no the ither wey roond, that congregations alane shuid caw meenisters tae serr, an the shuid be nae bishops. In 1578 the general assemly o the kirk took-on this theology, cryed Presbyterianism, but Morton kent fine that the kirk an king cuidna baith hae the say ower ceevil maiters. Morton haed mair tae fash him tho, for the erles o Argyll an Atholl heidit a pairty agin him in 1578. Thir pawkie cheils wis ower cute for Morton. In Mairch thay cawed a convention o nobles tae Stirlin. The faimly o the erle o Mar, that haed the keeping o the king, brocht the laddie alang an he annoonced that Morton cuidna keep the peace an shuid demit office. On 10 Mairch Morton’s demission wis acceptit. Bi the simmer Morton haed jyned the king’s cooncil again, but he haedna the maucht. The twal year auld king wis weel-lared an lang-heidit, reared at Stirlin unner the thrawn Latin scholar George Buchanan, that wisna sweirt tae chastify the boy. Jemmie aince murned that thay gart him write Latin afore he cuid speak Scots. His ither tutor, Paitrik Young, felt hert-sair for the wee sowel, but the king wis lanesome. It wisna muckle wunner that in September 1579, whan the king’s kizzen Esmie Stewart won at the coort fae Fraunce, an shawed a freenly face, Jemmie ettled efter him. In 1580 Jemmie made him erle o Lennox, an duik in 1581. Lennox pit hisel at the heid o the lords agin Morton. In Dezember 1580 ane o Lennox’s freens, Jeems Stewart, accused Morton o airt an pairt in the murder o the king’s faither Dernley. Morton wis liftit, an in Juin 1581 wis heidit on The Maiden, a forerunner o the guillotine that drappit its blade on a body’s craig aince the peg wis pullt awa. Jeems Stewart haed been made erle o Arran an he an Lennox noo airtit the king. Thay stood for a Frainch alliance an fairer dealings wi Catholics, but the erles o Gowrie, Angus an Glencairn, that heidit the Presbyterian pairty at coort, took a fleg. Whan the kirk tried tae abolish bishops, Lennox wadna gree til’t, sae the meenisters preacht agin him. Feart for the ploys o Philip o Spainie, an hoo faur the king wis in the aucht o Lennox, Weelum Ruthven erle o Gowrie wheecht the king awa while he wis huntin by Perth, in August 1582, an brocht him tae the Hoose o Ruthven (noo kent as Huntingtouer), whaur the callant wis held for the neist ten month. Gowrie an the Presbyterians jaloused thay cuid rule Scotland throu the presonar king an gart Lennox flee at the back-end. But in Juin 1583, Jemmie, noo 17, escapit an reposed Jeems erle o Arran. In Aprile 1584 whan a wheen nobles ettled at the cowpin o Arran, the king gaithert an airmy an chased them. Gowrie wis pit tae deith. Arran held a pairlament that pit throu acts settin kingly authority ower the kirk. The kirkmen cryed thir statutes ‘the Black Acts’. At the hinnerend Arran wis cowpit in Dezember 1585 wi uphaud fae Leezabeth o Ingland. She haed affen pit her neb in Scotland’s affairs but noo King Jem mie wad gar her pey for the richt. On 5 July 1586 he gree’d a league whaurby Leezabeth wad pey him £4,000 a year no tae mak alliances agin Ingland. Baith wad fend the ither agin ony invader, while Leezabeth wadna staun in the wey o ony richt Jemmie micht hae tae the croun o Ingland. In the years follaein, the maiter o Orkney an Shetland brocht mair trokin wi Denmark-Norrowa. In 1589 Jemmie gree’d a mairrage treaty an wis trystit on Ann the dochter o Freidrik II an

Sophie o Maitlanburg. Ann haed been born on 12 Dezember 1574 at Skandeborg castle in Jutland, but at her wa-gauin her ships wis driven bi storms intil Upslo in Norrowa. Jemmie hisel noo sailt ower tae Norrowa an the twasome wis mairried oot the Muckle Haw o the Auld Bishop's palace at Upslo, on 23 November 1589. Winnin hame in 1590 the war an affa steer aboot witches in North Berrick. The king wis tellt the witches haed gaithert wi the deil hisel, an unbeast wi burnin een, claws, an a rauch, howe voice, that tellt them tae cast cantrips for the deith o the king throu drounin him on his wey hame. Screeds o fowk wis taen an torturt, a puckle brunt or hung, but the maist byordnar wittins got oot the torture wis that the king’s ain kizzen, Frauncis erle o Bothwell, oxtert wi the deil. This wis a gleg ploy o the king’s. Bothwell wis a zeelous Protestant, whiles used bi the kirkmen agin the king, but he wis clearly gyte. Bi pittin his name forrit as the deil’s servitor, the king howpit fowk wad scunner at Bothwell. In fact the king played Calvinist an Catholic agin ane anither. The heid o the Catholic pairty wis George Gordon erle o Huntly. In 1589 King Jemmie haed maircht on Aiberdeen ower the heid o Huntly’s dealings wi Spainie, but the twa haed lang been freens an the king wis saft on him. Whan Bothwell haed the rare cheek on him tae raid the king’s hoose at Halyrood, in Dezember 1591, the king sent Huntly forrit wi commission tae hunt Bothwell an his pairt-takars. In Februar 1592 Huntly fund Bothwell’s freen the erle o Moray at the hoose o Donibristle in Fife, set the hoose alowe, an whan Moray fled on the shore, Huntly’s men claucht an haggit the erle tae deith. This steert up the kirk pairty ever mair an Bothwell daured tae mak twa mair raids on the king, in 1592 an 1594. In the hinner year Huntly, alang wi the erle o Erroll, haed mair dealings wi Spainie sae in the hairst King Jemmie led anither airmy north. Tho Huntly defait the erle o Argyll at Glenlivet, he wadna fecht the king, an fled. Bi 1596 the kirk haed gane ower faur whan meenisters preacht a Catholic plot an gart fowk riot in Embra. The king’s cooncil made it unlawfae tae speak ill o the king or his men. Huntly an Erroll cam hame tae Scotland an convertit tae Calvinism, at least in name. As tae Bothwell, he wis banisht, an syne dee’d ootland. Haein dealt wi the releegious zeelots for a wee, Jemmie socht tae peacify feuds atween the nobles an daunton the Borders an Heilans. He declared in 1597 that aw heritors in the Heilans an Isles shuid bring thair evidents tae the chakkar or loss thair lands. The king sent fleets tae the wast wi the heidmaist ettle o bringin in his rents, but in 1609 the heids o kin gree’d tae gie uphaud tae the kirk o Scotland an big new kirks. In 1616 the privy cooncil enactit that fae noo on heids o kin in the Heilans shuid learn the Scots leid, an leemit thair nummers o follaers. Atween 1599 an 1607 Jemmie alloued some Lawlan lords – the Fife Adventurers - tae ‘plant’ Lewis an turn oot the MacLeods, but at the hinnerend it wis anither Heilan cheil, MacKennie o Kintail, that bocht oot the disjaskit Lawlan company an plantit his ain fowk. The king haed a parteeclar hatrent for the MacGreigor clan, that he thocht held his authority in heich contemption, an in 1603, efter the clan haed blootert the Colquhouns at the fecht o Glenfruin, thair name wis banned an siller offert for MacGreigor heids. Jemmie took a parteeclar intress in the Borders whaur faimlies sic as the Airmstrangs, Kerrs an Scotts haed lang raidit ower the border, whiles brekin the truces made bi kings. Here, on the wast mairch, the

lang-staunin feud atween John lord Maxwell an Jeems Johnstoun o that ilk, brak intil open weir on 6 Dezember 1593 whan ane o the biggest fechts atween twa faimlies wis focht at the Sauns o Dryfe, by Lockerbie. In fact, Maxwell’s 2,000 follaers wis drawn ben the toun, skailt awgaits, an 700 o them cut doun bi Johnstoun’s 400 men. It wis thir lowse acts that King Jemmie cuidna thole. Whan Leezabeth o Ingland dee’d in Mairch 1603, Jemmie becam king o Ingland, Irland an Wales forby. He wis the first body tae ring ower the hail Breetish Isles his lane, wi nae kings contrair. Bidin maistly in Lunnon noo, Jemmie thocht hisel imperial. In 1604 he chenged his kingly style tae king o Great Britain, meanin the hail island, threapit on the uiss o the term Breetish, an cawed for a new jynt flag. He even socht the yoking o Ingland an Scotland wi ae pairlament, laws an releegion, but the Inglis an Scots cuidna gree on terms. Thay wad share a king, ay, an whiles wirk wi ane anither, but ithergaits wad haud-gauin as twa freestaunin kinriks. Jemmie wad veesit his hameland jist aince mair, atween Mey an August 1617, but he left the privy cooncil, steidit in Embra, tae run the kinrik. Hit wis heidit bi Alisaunder Seton erle o Dumfaurlin, as chauncellor (1605-1620), an syne Sir Tamas Hamilton as secretar o state (1612-1626). Thay kent hoo tae deal wi the king’s haunling, an whan tae tell the king he wis oot o touch gettin. The king haed, in 1606, brocht in bishops tae maister the kirk. He threapit that sindry auld rites sic as the celebration o parteeclar fests, sacraments, an kneelin at communion, shuid be taen-on bi the Presbyterians but thay war sair agin him. At the hinnerend mony fowk wadna conform tae the king’s Five Airticles o 1617, as thay war kent, sae the king said he wad mak nae mair novations. Noo that Jemmie’s maucht striddled baith kinriks he cuid deal wi auld fashery fae baith sides o the border. On the mairches the king ettled tae pit doun reivers. A jynt commission o Inglis an Scots, wi its ain polis, wis tried oot in 1605 an sut again in 1618. In 1607 he declared some lords o Ulster forfeit an cam up wi a ploy tae sattle Inglis an Lawlan Scots in thair steids, thinkin this wad haut Gaelic lords lowpin the sheuch tae haunder ane anither. The MacDonell faimly rose up throu 1614 an 1615, steert wi Campbell erle o Argyll that haed gotten chairters tae the king’s lands in thon airt. Campbell pit the rising doun an maistert the Sooth Isles, plantin Lawlan fowk at Inverera, an Cammeltoun in Kintyre. Anither quirky airt wis Orkney an Shetland whaur Queen Mary’s hauf-brither, Lord Robert Stewart, haed become erle an lord in 1581. His son Erle Paitrik – kent as Black Patie – ruled as a tirran ower his fowk. He took a lend o Norse an Scots law whaur it suitit him, an trokit wi the king o Denmark, but in 1608 the bishop o Orkney speirt for the king’s help. Paitrik wis cawed til Embra in 1609 an gien the jyle. Norse law wis abolisht in 1611 an whan the erle’s son stertit a rising, Paitrik wis pit tae deith in 1615. Ootland King Jemmie wis soukit intae the Thirty Year Weir (1618-48). His dochter Leezabeth had mairried on Freidrik V o the Palatinate in 1613 but whan the Protestant nobles o Bohemey made him king in 1619, insteid o the Imperor Ferdinand II, the twa gaed tae weir. Colonel John Seton an Sir Andra Gray took gey near 3,000 Scots ower, an the baith o them fund thairsels siegit in touns in Bohemey. Aince Freidrik wis near vankisht an the weir skailt intae the Palatinate,

King Jemmie cawed a pairlament in Embra in 1621 that votit siller for the weir an for the uphaud o his dochter Leezabeth. The king’s wife, Queen Ann, haed whiles insnorled hersel in the politics o the Scots coort. In parteeclar she made herself a fae o Chauncellor Maitland that haed claimed lands stentit pairt o Ann’s mairrage contract. In 1594 she took dowie efter the king gied Prince Hendrie tae be reared up wi the erle o Mar’s faimly at Stirlin, sae she an the Mar kinred wis cauldrife. She fleggit the king in 1593 whan she turnt a Catholic in hidlins, but Jemmie fund this uissfae in his dealings with the paip an Catholic pouers. Ann’s new releegion made her a freen o the erle o Huntly an whiles she pled his cause. But efter Ann gaed doun til Ingland she never played as muckle a pairt in coort politics as she haed done in Scotland. She dee’d on 4 Mairch 1619 at Hampton Coort in Lunnon. King Jemmie dee'd 27 Mairch 1625 at Tibbals Park Hoose, Ingland, an wis burried in Westmaister Abbey, Lunnon. Bringin aboot the jynt-kingships alane made him kenspeckle, but he wis novative in mony ither weys. He wis a poyet an a screivar, an wrate political warks sic as the Basilikon Doron o 1599. He decreed that in 1600 the year wad stert on 1 Januar insteid o the auld calcul o 25 Mairch, conform tae chenges in the calendar braid Europe. This new calcul is whit fowk uses the day. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 19
Walcome tae pairt nineteen o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot a thrawn king that tried tae be Breetish, but tint his croun an his heid. HOOSE O THE STEWART (haudin-gauin) Chairles I The Martyr 1625-1649 Born 19 November 1600 at Dumfaurlin, in Fife, Chairles wis the second son o Jemmie VI an Ann o Denmark. His faither haed become king o Ingland and Irland forby Scotland. Chairles’s brither Prince Hendrie wis the heir appearant until Hendrie took typhoid fever in 1612 an dee’d at the age o 18. Sae it wis Chairles that becam king in 1625. Born a Scot, but reared a Soothron, he thocht o hisel as Breetish, an suitit naebody. Chairles haed a rare conceit o hisel an-aw. His faither haed threapit that aw kings wis appyntit bi God, an while a king shuid respect the laws o the land, he, the king, answert tae naebody but God alane. Sae ony cheil that wis agin the king, wis agin God. Thay cryed this the divine richt o kings. Pridefae Chairles swallied this creed hail an hit becam the doundrag o his life. On 13 Juin 1625 Chairles wis mairried oot the kirk o Caunterberry on Hendretta Mary o Fraunce. She had been born 26 November 1609 at Pairis, an wis the dochter o Hendrie IV o Fraunce an Mary o Medici. His mairrage til a Catholic princess fleggit the mair kirk-reekit Protestants an steert causay clash agin the king whan it wis jaloused he dealt wi his subjects in sleekit weys. In 1625 Chairles lat it be kent that he wis awa tae revoke aw grants o croun lands gauin back tae 1540, sae fowk wad hae tae pey oot tae keep them, an tak back kirk lands that haed been convertit tae lordships. For Chairles the maiter o releegion wis gey simple. He wad tak back kirk lands that the nobles, lairds an ithers haed taen ower, foond new bishopries, an gie thir lands back tae the bishops. An throu the bishops, the king’s authority wad be restored ower the kirk. In thir same years, Chairles ettled at upstaunin taxation, upliftit ilka fower or five year, insteid o the ane-aff grants the estates o Scotland haed for ordnar gien. The fowk that the king lippent on maist, the nobles an the merchants, grew fykie at the king’s ploys, but he wadna tak a telling. Noo his faither’s Breetish practic stertit tae unfankle. In 1630 the Privy Cooncil in Embra decreed that fae noo on aw offeecial documents shuid evite the uiss o the term Great Britain, an the kingly style Chairles I king o Scotland, Ingland, Fraunce an Irland be used insteid. The Scots merchants an politeecians haed been fasht wi the king’s ettle at a common fisheries policy for Scotland an Ingland whaurby the Scots felt thair richts wis smoored unner the name o Britain. In Juin 1633 Chairles cam tae Scotland tae be crount and made a gang-roond the castles an kingly hooses o Dumfaurlin, Fauklan, Lithgae an Stirlin. He wis crount oot the king’s chaipel at Halyrood abbey on 18 Juin conform til Anglican

rites an makkin uiss o a roary flumgumerry that frichtit the minds o the Presbyterians. He noo threapit on the uiss o the Inglis prayer buik for Scotland, an the Five Airticles o Perth that his faither haed been cannie eneuch tae lea alane. The Embra pairlament wis tuithy, but Chairles turnt a deif lug tae the memmers an sut throu the sessions takkin tent tae the names o thaim that votit agin his novations. Lord Balmairnie, that haed taen a haun in pittin a peteetion agin the king’s policy, wis pit on trial for treason tae fleg the lave o the nobles. In 1634 Chairles decreed that the kirk shuid draw up a liturgy grundit on the Inglis ane, an his buik o canons, that kythed in 1636, made nae mention o kirk sessions, presbyteries or general assemlies. An Chairles wantit Embra made an airchbishopry, wi Saunt Geels as the heich kirk. He haed awready appyntit Airchbishop John Spottiswood o Saunt Aundraes as chauncellor in 1635 but the nobles steert the common fowk wi crack aboot paipish rites. On 23 July 1637 the new prayer buik wis read for the first time, at Saunt Geels kirk, bi the dean. Aw a sudden a shouer o buiks, stools an Bibles cam fleein at the dean fae aw weys as fowk, maistly weemen, cursed an skirled. An affa stramash brak oot an gairds haed tae chase them, but the stramash held-gauin ootby. Peteetions agin the prayer buik noo won at the Privy Cooncil fae sindry fowk. In 1637 twa men brocht the peteetioners thegither. The first wis Alisaunder Henderson meenister o Leuchars, skeely in political trokin an versant in the Presbyterian tradeetion. In 1638 he wad be electit moderator o the kirk assemly an in 1639 meenister o Saunt Geels. Syne he wad tak pairt in ambassadries in the comin years. The ither wis Airchibald Johnstoun o Warriston, an advocate that wad become a lord o the coort o session in 1641, but he cuidna see by his releegion an wis driven near gyte wi it. The twa o them wrate the National Covenant, a lang screive that set oot the sindry acts uphaudin the reformed releegion in Scotland an threapit that the king’s novations shuid be set aside til free general assemlies an pairlaments wis held. On 28 Februar 1638 mony o the nobles an lairds o Scotland pit thair hauns tae the Covenant at the Greyfreears kirk in Embra an gree’d tae fend ane anither an thair releegion agin ony faes. The meenisters o the kirk an the

burgesses follaed an doobles o the Covenant wis sent til aw the airts. In thae days Scotland haed mony airmies serrin ootland. Atween 1626-1629 Scots haed focht for Denmark-Norrowa. Unner Field Mairshall Alisaunder Lesslie an ithers thay focht for Swaiden fae 1628 until 1648, an mair Scots airmies focht in the Unitit Provinces o the Netherlands atween 1618 an 1648. Awthegither Scotland haed aboot 61,000 men serrin in airmies ootland throu the years 16181648 either bi license o the Privy Cooncil in Embra or ithergaits. The Covenant wis taen furth o Scotland tae thir airmies an Scots communities, for thaim tae sign, while siller an wappons, an sodgers an-aw, wis brocht hame. King Chairles wis ettlin tae invade Scotland fae Ingland an Irland an pit the Covenanters doun. In parteeclar, Ranald MacDonell erle o Antrim, that’s kinred haed been turnt oot o Kintyre wi the Campbells, offert tae invade the wast on behauf o the king an tak back the auld MacDonell lands. In the hairst o 1638 the new erle o Argyll wis Airchibald Campbell, kent as skellie Airchie. He wis a pawkie cheil that wad use the Covenant tae forder the maucht o his faimly an his ain poseetion at the croun o the causay. Wi baith sides bodin in fear o weir, the general assemly o the kirk forgaithert at Glesca heich kirk in November an Dezember 1638 an elided the king’s buik o canons, the Five Airticles, an cryed doun the office o bishops. Bi noo Field Mairshall Alisaunder Lesslie had won hame an wis appyntit heid o the Covenanter airmies. But ae cheil that wisna cantie wi aw this haunling wis George Gordon Markiss o Huntly. He wis maister o the north whaur mony fowk wis either Episcopal, or even Catholic, an the toun o Aiberdeen luewarm tae the hail stoushie ower the prayer buik. In Aprile 1639 Lesslie, alang wi Jeems Graham erle o Montrose, gaed north an claucht Aiberdeen. Huntly an his eldest loun George lord Gordon wis taen an brocht sooth til Embra, but anither loun o Huntly’s, Jeems lord Abyne, gaithert the Huntly kin an follaers. In Mey Ogilv y o Banff drave the Covenanters oot o Turra in a shairp fecht kent sensyne as ‘The Trot o Turra’ but Montrose maircht men til Aiberdeen an focht for the toun wi Abyne atween 14-19 Juin. Abyne held the Brig o Dee, but Montrose breenged at it until he gart them skail. At the same time King Chairles’s men haed invadit the Borders, but fund Lesslie wi his airmy at Duns Law an gied backs. The twa sides cryed birlie for a wee an King Chairles gaed aboot raisin anither airmy. While he wis daein this the Covenanters unner Montrose lichtit on Ingland in August 1640, defait the Inglis at Newburn Foord, maircht intae Newcastle, an usurpit the north o Ingland. The war naething the king cuid dae but mak a peace an bring the saecryed Bishops’ Weirs til an end. He cawed his Inglis pairlament an a treaty o peace wis made wi Scotland on 10 August 1641, cryed the Treaty o Lunnon. For King Chairles it wis bemeanin, haein tae confirm the acts o the Scots pairlament that noo cryed doun his releegious an ither policies. He wis in Scotland again fae August til November 1641 an sut throu a pairlament that haed been cawed athoot his say, an even makkin Argyll a markiss tae win his freenship. Hooanever, Jeems Graham erle o Montrose thocht that the Covenanters haed gane ower faur an took the rue. It wis weel seen that Airchibald o Argyll wis forderin his ain ends sae Montrose heidit a pairty agin Argyll an offert his help tae the king. The weir that the Covenanters haed steert noo spreid ithergaits. In 1641 the war a rising agin the Inglis an Sco ts sattlers in Irland, that’s news oxtert

back hame wi the ordnar tales o bairns on pikes. Sae the follaein year the Scots pairlament sent 11,000 sodgers ower til Ulster. The pairlament that the Chairles ane haed cawed in Ingland, for tae mak peace wi Scotland, lowsed aw kin-kind o threaps an hatrent agin the king an in 1642 weir brak oot atween him an his subjects in Ingland. Baith sides noo sent ambassadries tae Scotland for help. The Covenanters jaloused that alliance wi the Inglis pairlament wad be the best wey tae bell the kingly baudrons. In September 1643 the Covenanters and the Inglis pairlament gree’d a treaty cryed the Solemn League an Covenant. The reformed releegion wad be upheld in Scotland, the Inglis wad mak Ingland Presbyterian for the lend o a Scots airmy, an thay wad wirk for a political yoking o the twa kinriks that wad suit the baith. Sae in Januar 1644 an airmy o 20,000 Scots heidit bi Alisaunder an Dauvit Lesslie gaed intil Ingland. Syne, at the fecht o Marston Muir, on 2 July, Dauvit Lesslie led a breenge that brak the king’s airmy an Chairles tint the north o Ingland. Tae draw the Covenanters oot o Ingland, an aiblins brek thair haud ower Scotland, King Chairles haed appyntit Montrose the heid o his airmy. Montrose jyned wi Alisaunder MacDonell, a kinsman o the erle o Antrim, an blattert an blootert the hatit markiss o Argyll. Ding dang the airmies o the Covenant fell. In September 1644 Montrose took Perth efter the fecht at Tippermuir an sackit Aiberdeen, won the fecht at Fyvie in October, an in the Dezember gart Argyll flee fae his ain hame at Inverera. He defait Argyll at Innerlochy in Februar 1645, but haed tae gie backs whan the Covenanters unner Baillie surprised him at Dundee in Aprile, an he fled in the Heilans. Hooanever, Montrose cam back wi mair men an brak the Covenanters in three fechts, at Auldearn (9 Mey), Aaford (2 July) an Kilseyth (15 August). Montrose haed Scotland awmaist in his aucht, but aince his airmy stertit tae traipse hame, til Aiberdeenshire an Kintyre, he wis scrimp o airms. On 13 September 1645 Dauvit Lesslie fund him at Philiphauch by Selkirk an gied Montrose a sair defait that he never got abuin. Chairles wis lossin the weir in Ingland an randert tae the Scots airmy at Newark in Mey 1646. In Juin he ordert his airmy heids in Scotland, Huntly an Montrose, tae gie ower an skail thair men. The Covenantit airmy took Chairles tae Newcastle an lang political trokin gaed on atween the Scots an the Inglis. The govrenment in Embra wis feart that bringin Chairles intae Scotland wad steer up trouble, sae

thay gied him tae the Inglis pairlament in return for the siller Ingland wis auchtin for airmy pey, in Januar 1647. But mony Scots soon took the rue. In the simmer o 1647 the Inglis airmy cowpit the state an took Chairles a presonar. Sleekit tae the hinnerend, Chairles played fowk aff agin ane anither, an in Dezember 1647 made a league in hidlins wi a puckle Scots nobles heidit bi Jeems duik o Hamilton. Thay wad send an airmy tae free an uphaud the king. In return Chairles gree’d he wad whiles bide in Scotland, try oot Presbyterianism on Ingland for three year, an mak a third o the coort an privy cooncil in Ingland Scots. The sae-cryed Engager airmy invadit Ingland in July 1648, but its heids hae nae clear ettles, an it wis defait at Preston (17-19 August) bi the Inglis general Oliver Crumell. Aboot 2000 wis killt an gey near 9000 taen presonar. It wis noo the turn o the kirk-reekit zeelots o Ayrshire an Lanark – cryed the Whiggamores – tae cowp the state. Thay maircht on Embra, chased the comatee o estates, an took ower, pittin Argyll at thair heid. A screed o acts wis passt in Januar 1649 bannin fae office awbody that haed taen pairt in the Engagement or haed aince gien uphaud tae Montrose. A wheen fowk in Ingland, led bi General Crumell, noo socht the life o the king as a bluidy tirran an pit him on trial. On 30 Januar 1649 Chairles wis heidit at Whitehaw palace. It wis a cauld morning, but Chairles pit on twa sarks sae he wadna chitter an look feart. He wis burried in St George's chaipel, in Windsor, Ingland. His wife, Queen Hendretta Mary, haed fled tae Fraunce in 1644 an she dee’d at Colombe by Pairis on 10 September 1669. © Dauvit Horsbroch

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 2
Walcome tae pairt twa o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot the Jynt kings o Dalriada an Pechtland fae AD 789 til AD 900 HOOSE O FERGUS Constantine son o Fergus 789-820 Constantine son o Fergus o Dalriada, a Gaelic-speakin Scot, wis the first king tae rule ower baith Pechts an Scots. Becomin king o Dalriada in 785 he conquest the kinrik o Fortrui bi 789, an, bi 800, the lave o Pechtland. He flittit fae the wast tae the Pechtish east an held his coort in thae airts. Tho his mither leid wis Gaelic, he wis appearinly at hame wi Pechtish tradeetions. It micht be that the Viking raids that haed stertit in his day, led til his slidder grup on Pechtland efter 814 but it wis unner Constantine an his follaers on the throne that the kinrik o Scotland wis born. Ae tradeetion threaps that he dee'd in Kilchousland monastery in Kintrye in 820. Innes son o Fergus 820-834 Innes wis the brither o Constantine. He wis maist likely king o Dalriada unner his brither an syne follaed him as owerlord o baith Pechts an Scots in 820. Auld fernyears claims that Innes brocht the relics o Saunt Andra tae Scotland. It is clear eneuch that the first kirk at Kilrimont, biggit in the 8ct century, wis repairit in his day, an a sma toun grew up as mair an mair pilgrims made thair wey tae worship at the releegious cult. Syne the toun wad be cryed Saunt Aundraes in the Scots leid. King Innes upheld the maucht o his kin an wis follaed bi his nevey as king ower baith the Pechts an Scots. Durstane son o Constantine 834-837 The nevey o King Innes. No muckle is kent aboot this king o twa-three year but the Vikings micht’a brocht aboot his dounfaw. Ewen son o Innes 837-839 King Ewen - alang wi mony o the Pechtish an Scots heids o kin - fell in a muckle fecht agin the Vikings in Fortriu in 839. Atween 839 an 848 Ewen's kizzen, Kennet son o Alpin, an a faimly o Pechtish kings fae the north-east o Scotland, wis at heid an aix ower the disputit owerkingship. HOOSE O ALPIN Kennet son o Alpin 839-858 Kennet cam tae pouer in the days whan the Dens an Norse - the Vikings - defait the Scots an Pechts in Fortriu. His faither micht’a been slauchtert in the same fecht an sae Kennet becam king ower Dalriada. In 843 he took the owerlordship o Pechtland an-aw, an gauin bi auld accoonts – an modren speirings – it wis a bluidy adae. The war a puckle kings in north-east Pechtland that focht agin him but Kennet wis the maister an mair

bi 848. Stories o his slauchter o the Pechts is grundit on the fechts o the 840s, while chroniclers tells us that Kennet invadit Lothian a hantle times. Kennet follaed his kinsmen in makkin the Pechtish east his sate o pouer: dootless he wis lossin land tae the Norse. Kennet brocht in help fae Irland, an made mairrage alliances wi the Brets, an even the Vikings an-aw. He dee'd on the 8 Februar 858 at his hoose o strength at Forteviot. Donal I son o Alpin 858-862 He wis the son o Alpin an brither o Kennet. Donal follaed his brither as king an haed tae fecht wi the Norse, but didna lang ring. He dee'd 13 Aprile 862 at Scoun. Constantine I son o Kennet 862-877 Son o Kennet. Like his faither an uncle, Constantine haed tae politic an warsle wi the Norse turn aboot acause his kinrik o Alba wis on the gate atween the Viking kinriks o Dublin an York, an astrictit tae the north bi the Norse in the isles. In 875 the Vikings focht the Brets an the Pechts efter the Vikings haed been driven oot o York, an syne thay stertit tae spyle Alba. Bi 877 Constantine wis aw oot wi the ootlins an brocht them tae fecht, either at Innerdovat in Angus or by Dollar in Fife, but he wis defait an killt. Heith Lichtfit 877-878 Heith wis anither son o Kennet. Heith follaed his brither as king but haed tae fecht wi the Norse reengin the kinrik. Forby thon fashery, Heith wisna lang in pouer whan the kinred o Greigor made a claim on the croun an brocht him tae fecht at Strathallan, Perthshire, whaur he wis killt. Greigor son o Donal 878-889 Greigor wis the son o Donal I and kizzen o Heith. In thae days the kingship wis held bi the custom o tanistry. This meant that aw the adult men o the faimly, sprung fae the same gransher, haed a richt tae kingship. Nae bairn cuid be king an the croun wis aye held bi an adult man, but it led tae deidly feuds an slauchters acause that mony cheils cuid pit forrit thair ain claims. The kinsmen o Greigor maist likely slew Heith wi a haunder fae Dumbertan an ruled Alba while Eochy, anither kizzen, held Dumbertan itsel. Greigor dee'd at Dundurn ab.889 Eochy o Dumbertan 878-889 Eochy wis the son o Rhun king o Dumbertan that wis mairried til a dochter o Kennet son o Alpin. Eochy’s granfaither, Habart, haed been slain bi Constantine I sae historians jalouse thon micht’a been the reason for his uphaud o Greigor agin the family o Heith. Eochy wis likely a haufling whan he cam tae the kingship but he ruled alang wi Greigor in Alba. The twa kings fell fae pouer in 889 an wis herried oot the kinrik. Eochy wis the hinmaist o the hamelt kings o Dumbertan. His time an place o deith is unkent.

Donal II The Gallus 889-900 Donal The Gallus wis the son o Constantine I. Donal I led his kin agin Greigor an Eochy in 889 an took the croun for hisel. In the years 889-90 Donal appearinly conquest Dumbertan, garrin Eochy flee. Mony Brettonic nobles noo took thairsels aff in a muckle flittin tae thair kinsmen in Wales. It wis unner Donal II that the Gaelic Scots first lowpit the Skot Watir – or Firth o Forth - bade amang the Auld-Angles speakin fowk, an won owerance o the lands o Lothian. Lothian haed been pairt o the kinrik o Northummerland, but hit haed been conquest wi the Dens no lang afore, leain Lothian tae staun its lane. King Donal wis novative in kirk an state bi elidin awthing in Pechtish law that wisna conform tae the laws an weys o the Gaels. Fae noo on the wad be nae question that the Gaelic leid an customs wis tae come afore aw ither tradeetions in the kinrik o Alba. King Donal dee'd at Dunnottar in 900. He haed brocht aw the kinriks o the north intae the girth o Alba.

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 4
Walcome tae pairt fower o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot the kings o auld Alba, haudin-gauin, atween 1005 an 1093. Maucom II son o Kennet 1005-1034 Born ab.954, Maucom wis the son o King Kennet II, an wis awready aboot 50 whan he took the kingship, but it’s weel seen he wis a raucle an forcie cheil. In 1006 Maucom haed tae tak up airms tae hae his owerlordship o Lothian acceptit, but he wis defait –likely in a siege at Durham - but in 1018 he led a thrang o an airmy ower the Tweed an defait Northummerland at the fecht o Carham on Tweed, takkin ower Lothian aince an for aw. The Auld-Angles speakin fowk, that haed lang bade here, noo haed the king o Alba for a king, but thair ain heich-reeves, steidit at Dunbar an ither strengths, held-gauin as the hame-aboot rulers. Maucom II haed memmers o his faimly mairry on tae the faimly o the heich reeves, the erles o Orkney, an the mormaers o Moray, as a wey o haudin aw thae lands athin the girth o Alba. It seems that in thae days the mormaers o Moray weirred agin the mormaers o Atholl, burnin Dunkell in 1027, an that Thorfin, erle o Orkney, granson o Maucom II, focht agin Moray as ally o the king. But the differs the kings o Alba an Ingland haed ower the mairchlands wadna dwine: in 1031 Scotland wis invadit bi Canute o Ingland an Maucom made a treaty raither nor fecht. Maucom ruled maistly fae Fife, an wantit his granson tae follae him as king, in muckle the same wey as Kennet II haed wantit. Efter the custom o thae times Maucom set aboot his kinsfowk, slauchterin or hurtin tae the ill aw ither claimants, sae that jist his ain line wad be left staunin. But his ettles at chengin the rules o king-makkin steert up a stoushie. At the hinnerend, a puckle nobles fund the king at Glamis, an killt him on 25 November 1034. Throu his win at Carham, in 1018, Maucom II is regairdit in auld fernyears an chronicles as the king that confirmed, for ever mair, that his kinrik o Alba wad rule ower the lands sooth o the Forth. An he wis the hinmaist king o the direct line o the Hoose o Alpin. Duncan I 1034-1040 Born ab.1000, Duncan wis the son o Criny o Dunkel an Betoc dochter o Maucom II. He wis mairried ab.1030 on Sybilla Bjornsdochter, dochter o Bjorn Bearsson. Whan Ewen the Baldie-heidit, king o Dumbertan, wis killt in 1018, Duncan follaed him as king o thon land. It noo

becam the tradeetion that the heirs o the kings o Alba held the kingship o Dumbertan. But Duncan wis nae sodger: he breenged intae weirs agin Northummerland, an Moray, an took defaits ding ding. His weak kingship wis seen as an inlat bi a curn nobles that rose up wi Macbaith the mormaer o Moray at thair heid, an Duncan wis killt fechtin them on 14 August 1040 at Burgheid Macbaith Finlak 1040-1057 Born ab.1005, Macbaith wis the son o Finlak mormaer o Moray. He wis mairried sometime efter 1032 on Grouch, grandochter o Kennet III. Macbaith Finlak, faur fae bein the ill-kindit king o historian Hector Boece, or screivar Shakespeare's norries, wis a strang king that rang for 17 year. His faimly – whiles kent as the Hoose o Moray – haed lang ettled at the kingship an wis mair skeely, an cannie, in haudin the croun nor Duncan haed been. Macbaith wis that weel-stellt that he cuid even gae tae Rome in 1050, whaur it wis said that he wis lairge wi his siller. Hooanever, at the hinnerend, the heirs o deid King Duncan cam chappin at his door. Twa sons o Duncan, Maucom an Donal, haed been sent awa oot the kinrik efter thair faither haed been killt, ane son tae the north, an ane son tae the sooth. Noo, the elder son Maucom haed been sent tae the coort o Ingland, an tae bide in York wi his kinsman Siward erle o Northummerland. In 1054 Siward an Maucom gaithert thegither an airmy an invadit first Lothian, an syne Alba north o the Forth. King Macbaith haed traivelled an dootless first met in wi the Normans aboot 1050. The Normans, that haed a Norse oreeginal, but wis noo Frainchified, wis skeely at airms an weirfare, an sae Macbaith brocht in a hantle peyed Norman sodgers tae Scotland. His airmy focht Siward at Dunsinane, in Perthshire, but it wis Macbaith an his fowk that haed tae gie backs. Appearinly, the king noo tint his pouer in the sooth, in Lothian, an fell back on his hame-airt o Moray. In 1057, Maucom invadit Alba itsel, focht wi Macbaith at Lumphanan, in Aiberdeenshire, an hurtit the king tae the deith. Soon efter, on 16 August, Macbaith dee’d at Scoun. Aulach Fool 1057-1058 Born ab.1032, Aulach wis the son o Grouch an Gilchoan mormaer o Moray, an stepson o Macbaith. As wis the ordnar custom, Aulach wis made king bi a wheen nobles follaein on the deith o Macbaith, but he didna lang bear the gree. Maucom fund an killt him at Essie in Strathbogie on 17 Mairch 1058.

HOOSE O CAINMORE Maucom III Cainmore 1058-1093 Born ab.1031, Maucom wis the son o Duncan I an Sybilla Bjornsdochter. A month efter the deith o Aulach, Maucom wis made king on 25 Aprile 1058, at Scoun. It is likely that the king o Ingland thocht haein Maucom as king o Scots wad mean a freenly neebor tae the north, ane that wad dae Ingland nae skaith, but Maucom soon shawed that it wis Scandinaivie that he wis drawn taewards. Aboot a year efter he becam king, he wis mairried on Ingibiorg, thocht tae be dochter o Finn Arnesson erle o Halland in Norrowa. The kings o Norrowa claimed owerlordship ower the hail islands an pairts o the wast o Scotland, an the erles o Orkney wis weelstellt in the north. But the war different claims tae Northummerland an Lothian, bi baith kings o Ingland an Scotland. In 1059 Maucom peyed a veesit til

Ingland, aiblins tae redd-up ony disagreeances, but in 1061 he invadit Northummerland, an spylt Halyisland on the wey. This wis the first o a wheen invasions o the north o Ingland. In 1066 Ingland wis invadit an conquest wi the Normans. The Auld-Angles heirs til Ingland, Edgar an his sister Magret, landit in Scotland twa-three year efter this. Magret – better kent in Scots history as Saunt Magret – wis born in Ungairy ab.1045 an wis reared thareawa. Her faither wis Edwart the Athling o Ingland an her mither, Agatha, wis maist likely the dochter o Luidolf margrave o Wastfreishland. Maucom’s wife Ingibiorg haed dee’d ab.1068, an noo, ab.1070, he wis mairried on Magret at Dumfaurlin. An it wis fae Dumfaurlin, an whiles the fort at Embra, that Maucom maistly ruled ower his kinrik. He brocht new weys tae the Scots coort, fae Ingland, fae Fraunce an ither pairts o Europe. Sic chenges wis pairtly an affcome o his mairrage tae Magret, tho it maun be said that thae chenges wisna as faur-raxin as aince jaloused. Maucom hisel, it is said, spak twa-three leids: his ain mither tongue Gaelic, the Auld-Angles leid o Lothian an Northummerland, an even a bittie Frainch an Latin. Queen Magret wis affa releegious, some wad say kirk-reekit, an fund faut in muckle aboot the Catholic kirk in Scotland. She wantit tae reform it, tae bring customs an haunts in Scotland mair in line wi the wey things wis done in the Latin kirk at Rome. Turgot, the kirkman that wrate Magret’s life story, said that she debatit wi the monks an bishops in Scotland, an that she brocht in new-fangled ceremony tae the Scots coort. But, in the backgrund, the maucht o the Norman Frainch threitent the kinrik. Maucom’s claims on Northummerland an Cummerland wad bring aboot his dounfaw. In 1070 he invadit Northummerland. In turn, in 1072, Weelum I o Ingland invadit wi an airmy an fleet the length o Abernethy on the Tay, an gart Maucom parley. Maucom gree’d no tae gie beild til Ingland’s unfreens – in Scandinaivie an ither airts - an haundit ower a son, Duncan, in guid faith. In maugre o thon, Maucom lowsed on Ingland, again, in 1079, bringin a Norman airmy intae Lothian in turn. The twa sides forgaithert at the Fawkirk tae speak aboot peace, while the Normans biggit a new castle on the Tyne, jist in case. The biggin o castles bi the Normans wis anither wey o takkin ower the land. Noo the war a line o forts an hooses o strength gauin the length o Cairel tae Newcastle. In the hairst o 1091 Maucom, wi his guid-brither, Edgar the Atheling, invadit aince mair, the length o Durham, an came hame humphin spyles o weir. The Inglis king invadit Lothian wi an airmy an fleet, an Maucom gree’d anither peace, noo peyin homage tae the Inglis king for lands grantit him in Ingland. But in the ware o 1092 the Normans took Cairel an turnt oot the ruler, Maucom’s kizzen.

Whither or no he wis owerly fasht aboot his kizzen, it seems this shaw o Norman maucht wis eneuch tae fleg the Scots king. In August 1093 he gaed tae Durham tae speak wi the Inglis king, Weelum The Rid, but Weelum took the pet an wadna see him. Maucom, bi noo beelin, gaed hame an gaithert anither airmy. It is said that Queen Magret, lyin no weel at Embra, askit her man no tae invade, but he wadna tak tent. In November 1093 Maucom, alang wi twa o his sons, Edwart an Edgar, led the airmy sooth, but at Anneik on 13 November, he an his son Edwart wis slain bi treachery. Queen Magret dee’d jist days efter, on 16 November. No lang efter the king wis burried at Dumfaurlin. In the inward affairs o his ain kinrik Maucom haed been mair successfae. In Moray he haed tae warsle wi Melsnechty (son o Aulach Fool) but defait him in 1085. He wis at peace wi the Norse erles o Orkney for maist o his time as king, throu mairrage an ither treaties. Abuin aw, fowk will aye mind o Maucom as the king that focht the Normans. His by-name o Cainmore comes fae the Gaelic words meanin ‘Big Heid’, aiblins acause he wis wee llared, tho it wisna a name gien him in his ain lifetime. His kinred an follaers on the throne haes generally been kent in Scots history as the Hoose o Cainmore.

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 5
Walcome tae pairt five o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot the Hoose o Cainmore atween the years 1093 an 1153. Donal III Bain 1093-1097 Born ab.1033, Donal Bain wis a son o Duncan I an Sybilla Bjornsdochter. His by-name o bain springs fae the Gaelic meanin ‘white’. As the brither o King Maucom, an the auldest male o the faimly, Donal took the kingship, unner the custom o tanistry, as soon as he kent his brither wis deid. Tae mak guid his claim, Donal siegit Embra castle whaur Queen Magret haed dee’d, an it is said, her corp haed tae be smuggled oot for burrial at Dumfaurlin. Donal is affen regairdit as a gey inward-lookin king, gauin bi whit twa-three Soothron chronicles haed tae say, but he didna want ony Normans or ithers pittin thair nebs intil his kinrik. But the Normans wadna lea Scotland alane. In Mey 1094 his nevey Duncan, reared in the weys o Norman knichtheid, wis sent up fae Ingland wi an airmy on the grunds that Duncan wis the eldest son o King Maucom. Gauin bi Duncan, an gauin bi the Norman wey o thinkin, it wis the eldest son that wis the appearant heir, nae maiter whit his age. Thay cryed this kind o kingship, primogeniture. King Donal wis at first defait an haed tae gie backs, but in November 1094 Donal an anither nevey, cryed Edmund, focht for the kingship aince mair. For near on three year, uncle an nevey ruled Scotland thegither, until thay got dung doun bi anither nevey, Edgar, in October 1097. Donal wis taen presonar an endit his days blindit an libbit. Nae king hoched an hurtit in sic a wey cuid rule. He dee’d in 1099 at Rescobie, in Angus, an wis the hinmaist king o Scots burried on Iona. Duncan II 1094 Born ab.1060, Duncan wis the son o Maucom III an Ingibiorg. He wis mairried on Ethelreida o Dunbar ab.1090, dochter o Cospaitrik erle o Northummerland. For the price o a Norman airmy Duncan becam the 'man' o Weelum o Ingland, a fact that the Scots nobles cuidna thole. Duncan’s life wisna warth a docken aince he sent the Normans oot the kinrik. A curn nobles, heidit bi the mormaer o the Mearns, killt Duncan at Mondynes, by modren Steinhyve, on 12 November 1094, an brocht Donal Bain back tae pouer. Gin fowk minds o Duncan ava, it wis the first king o Scots tae gie oot a wrutten chairter, this ane bein tae the monks at Durham in 1094. Edgar The Lown 1097-1107 Born ab.1075, Edgar wis the son o Maucom III an Saunt Magret. Ding dang, like his aulder hauf-brither, Edgar haed a lend o Norman sodgers aff the king o Ingland an becam his 'man'. Donal Bain, as said afore, wis defait an gien the jyle. Acause the Norman kings o Ingland haed gien sodgers tae claimants tae claucht the kingship o Scotland, thay regairdit the Scots kings as owe them homage. Hoo this wis tae wirk in practice, an whither or no it wis jist atween kings for the time, or ongauin for the hail kinrik, wisna clear, an wad lead tae miskens an fawoots for the

follaein twa hunner year. In the wast, in 1098, Edgar cam up agin King Manus Barries o Norrowa. The Waster Isles an pairts o Argyll haed fell tae the Norse lang syne, an the wisna muckle Edgar cuid dae athoot makkin a stoushie. Raither nor fecht, Edgar haed tae gree that the Waster Isles belanged the croun o Norrowa. King Edgar dee'd unmairried on 8 Januar 1107 at Embra castle. It seems he wis kent as ‘the lown’ acause he wis easy-osy an wantit nae trouble. Alisaunder I The Fiersie 1107-1124 Born ab.1077, Alisaunder wis the neist son o Maucom III an Saunt Magret. He wis mairried on Sybilla, dochter o Hendrie I o Ingland bi his fancy-wife Sybilla Corbet. Unner baith Edgar an Alisaunder I the kings o Scots haed guid neeborheid wi the kings o Ingland. In fact, thair sister Maud wis the wife o Hendrie I, an sae queen o Ingland, an thair ither brither, Dauvit, wis ane o the foremaist barons o Ingland, haudin mony estates. Alisaunder stertit tae bigg castles in the Norman wey, an tae grant oot lands til a puckle Norman, Inglis an ither fowk that wis for sattlin doun in Scotland an bringin new skeels. Still an aw, he haed tae caw cannie o Ingland’s maucht, an his brither Dauvit’s cheepin at Hendrie’s lug. In 1113 it seems that Dauvit even threitent his brither Alisaunder wi his Norman freens an wis gien the rule ower whit is noo the sooth o Scotland. The follaein year, in 1114, Alisaunder serred in the airmy o Hendrie o Ingland that lichtit on Gwynedd in Wales, aiblins tae win back Hendrie’s favour, whaur it is said Alisaunder brocht aboot peace atween King Griffith an King Hendrie. But Alisaunder whiles ettled at policy free o Ingland. The airchbishops o Caunterberry an York baith claimed that the bishops o Scotland wis owe thaim allegiance, but Alisaunder stood agin thir claims. He haed howps o haein the kirk in Scotland recognised as freestaunin bi the paipacy, an brocht the Augustinian order tae Scoun aboot 1115. Ane o thir monks, Robert, wis made bishop o St Aundraes bi Alisaunder in 1124. The king earned for hisel the by-name o ‘the fiersie’ whan he pit doun a rising in Moray bi the affspring o the faimly o King Aulach Fool. It cuid be richtly said, that neither Alisaunder, or his brither Edgar, wis Gaelic or Auld-Angles in culture alane, but striddled the baith. Alisaunder dee'd on 23 Aprile 1124 at Stirlin castle an wis burried at Dumfaurlin. His wife Queen Sybilla, haed dee’d on 12 July 1122 at Loch Tay. Dauvit I The Saunt 1124-1153 Born ab.1080, Dauvit I wis the youngest son o Maucom III an Saunt Magret. Dauvit wis in Scotland til aboot 1097 an syne gaed til Ingland. His sister, Maud, wis mairried on the king o Ingland in 1100 an bi 1103 Dauvit wis at the coort o Ingland as a chairter witness styled ‘brither o the queen’. It wis here that Dauvit dootless learnt Frainch, becam a knicht in the Norman fashion, an made mony Norman, Breton an Fleemish freens. He wis mairried ab.1114 on Maud o Huntingdon, dochter o Waltheof erle o Huntingdon an Northampton, an Judith dochter o Coont Lambert o Lens. Bi this mairrage, he haed a strang claim tae Northummerland. Acause Dauvit haed bade maistly amang the Normans, he seemed Frainchified tae Brettonic, Gaelic an Lothian cheils bi the time he follaed his brither on the throne, in 1124. He wis made king at Scoun, maist likely in Mey o thon year, an it is said that he didna think muckle o the actual king makkin for its want o releegious rites. Ae cheil, Weelum Duncanson, son o Dauvit’s elder hauf brither King Duncan, haed a better claim tae be king, but he did deil a haet

aboot his claim. Anither nevey, Maucom Sanderson, the natural son o King Alisaunder, led a rising agin Dauvit in 1124, but it wis shairply pit doun. Dauvit wis maist at hame in his lands in whit is noo the sooth o Scotland, in Lothian an the Borders, an in the faur north o Ingland, but he socht tae bigg up his say in the ither airts whaur his faimly mibby wisna as strang. The maist kenspeckle airts wis Moray an Caitnes tae the north, an Gallowa an the Firth o Clyde tae the wast. Tho the king o Scots wis the maist important o the rulers in the north o the Breetish Isles, the war a hantle sma kings yet. Ane o thir men wis cryed Fergus the rí – or king – o Gallowa. Dauvit brocht twa-three o his Normans freens tae the region – sic as Robert de Bruce – fae the 1120’s onwards. In the wast, Sumerleid wis the rí o Argyll an haed his een on the Firth o Clyde. Here Dauvit brocht in fowk he cuid lippen on: Hugh o Morville an Walter Aulanson, an gied them lands in north Ayrshire an Renfrew. In the faur north, the war a feud gauin on atween the kinreds o Orkney an Caitnes, that wisna ony guid for Dauvit’s ideas o siccar rule tae the soo th. It suitit him braw whan his ain erle o Atholl got his son Harald acceptit as ane o the erles o Orkney in 1139, drawin Caitnes an Sutherland awa fae Norrowa an taewards Scotland. Hooanever, in 1151 King Eystein o Norrowa turnt up wi a fleet, claucht Harald at Thursa, gart him sweir allegiance tae Norrowa, an syne sailt doun an brunt the toun o Aiberdeen. Aiblins, tho, it wis Moray that fasht King Dauvit the maist. It wis fae thon airt that claims agin his croun cam. In 1130 Maucom Sanderson, thegither wi Innes rí o Moray – a granson o King Aulach – led a rising agin Dauvit. Thair airmy got the length o Stracathra by Brechin in Angus, afore it wis defait wi Dauvit’s constable, Edwart Siwardson, an Innes hisel killt alang wi mony o his follaers. Maucom Sanderson got awa, but wis liftit an gien the jyle for life in 1134. In the twa-three year efter 1134, Dauvit’s men defait the men o Moray an the king stertit takkin lands an giein them tae the kirk. His nevey Weelum Duncanson wis gien lordship ower Moray, but whan Weelum dee’d ab.1147, Dauvit brocht Moray unner his ain, direct rule. It wis noo that he brocht in a puckle Norman an Fleemish knichts, tae the new castles at Auldearn, Elgin an Forres, an burgesses til his new touns. Ane o thir ootlins, Freskin the Fleeming, wis gien the lands o Duffus north o Elgin. Syne his faimly took the name o Murray. The king foondit a wheen burghs whaur tredsmen cuid sell thair wares an cairry on aw kinds o haunling sae lang as thay peyed the king taxes on guids bocht an sellt. Amang the new burghs o King Dauvit’s wis Aiberdeen, Berrick, Elgin, Embra, Perth, an Roxbra. Deed, it wis Roxbra that wis faurben wi the king an he is affen fund haudin his coort thareawa. Forby the burghs, Dauvit wis the first Scots king tae ootgie his ain coinage; the siller penny, stertin in 1136. He haed a curn mints steidit in touns sic as Aiberdeen, Berrick, Embra an Perth, an gied his coins a Scots design efter 1141. Dauvit wis the patron o mony new releegious hooses braid Scotland, sic as Halyrood an Melrose. In 1136, for instance, he an his hail coort, bringin Gaelic, Lothian an Norman lords thegither, attendit the foondin o the new heich kirk at Glesca. In 1135, while the Inglis haed a ceevil weir gauin on, Dauvit pit forrit his claims tae Cummerland an Northummerland, an invadit. His ettle wis tae conquest the north o Ingland for his son Prince Hendrie. Mony castles an hooses o strength wis siegit. In 1138, Dauvit lichtit on Ingland while the king o Ingland lichtit on Lothian, an baith brunt the ithers’ lands. Weelum Duncanson blootert

an Inglis airmy at Clitheroe in the Juin, but on 22 August King Dauvit wis defait at Cowton Muir, in Yorkshire, in a fecht the Inglis cryed The Staundart. It seems that Dauvit’s airmy wis tore atween the Gaelic lords, unner Malise erle o Strathearn, an the Norman lords an knichts, that haed gey different weys o makkin weir. The men o Gallowa, at the heid o the Scots airmy, breenged ramstam at the Inglis airmy but wis broken in turn bi the Norman knichts an thair airchers. This affcome pit the Scots airmy in a swither, an Dauvit an his men haed tae gie backs. Hooanever, the Scots airmy sut doun ower the wunter an held maist o the north o Ingland. In Aprile 1139 Dauvit cam awa wi a rare treaty makkin his son Prince Hendrie, erle o Northummerland, an lord o Cummerland. This meant that fae the dowp-end o the 1130s until 1157, Dauvit, Prince Hendrie, an Hendrie’s son Maucom, haed the lordship o maist o the lands fae Sutherland tae Yorkshire intae thair hauns. Dauvit’s e ttles at haein the kirk in Scotland recognised bi the paip as freestaunin – lowsed fae the claims o Caunterberry or York - fell throu, but he left Scotland strang, free, an noo a pairt o the European mercat. He dee'd 29 Mey 1153 at Cairel castle in Cummerland an wis burried at the abbey o Dumfaurlin. He wis aboot 73 year auld. His wife Maud haed dee’d ab.1130 an wis burried in Scoun. Dauvit foondit, or dedicatit again, mony kirks, an for this reason wis kent sensyne as ‘the saunt’. Prince Hendrie erle o Northummerland Born ab.1115, Hendrie wis the ae son o Dauvit I an Maud o Huntingdon. He wis mairried in 1139 on Ada o Warwin, dochter o Weelum o Warwin erle o Surrey, in Ingland, an Isabel Crepi dochter o Hugh coont o Vermandois. Tho he wis never king in his ain richt, Hendrie wis rex designatus, meanin the king that’s tae come, an clearly associatit wi his faither Dauvit in the rule o Scotland. The idea that a son follaed a faither as king, wis noo stertin tae become acceptit in Scotland, tho twa-three cheils yet haed ither thochts on the maiter. Hendrie wis ruler ower Northummerland an Cummerland in his ain richt forby, takkin aiths o allegiance fae aw the barons, an the lave, in the north o Ingland. Like his faither, Hendrie wis Frainchified in culture an leid. He dee'd 12 Juin 1152, either at the Newcastle or Roxbra, an wis burried at the abbey o Kelsae in the Borders. His deith afore his faither meant that the new king o Scots, his son Maucom, wad maist likely be a laddie, gien that King Dauvit wis noo an auld man.

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 6
Walcome tae pairt sax o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot the kings o Scots atween 1153 an 1214. Maucom IV The Maiden 1153-1165 Born 20 Mairch 1142, Maucom wis son o Prince Hendrie an Ada o Warwin, an granson o King Dauvit I. It haed been the ettle o King Dauvit that Hendrie wis tae follae him on the throne – clear eneuch that the kingship wis chengin fae the auld custom o walin the best king fae amang the kinred – but wi Hendrie’s deith his son Maucom IV becam Scotland’s first boy king. Sae an 11 year auld laddie wis noo made king at Scoun. Appearinly Duncan erle o Fife wis guardian o Maucom as a bairn an maist likely ruled on his behauf for twa-three year, at least til 1157. Maucom wis an oot-an-oot Norman in his fancies an freens, a fact that fasht a wheen nobles. But waur in thair een, wis this young king no staunin up tae the Inglis king. In July 1157 Maucom met wi Hendrie o Ingland an disponed his lands o Cummerland an Northummerland, Hendrie giein him the erledom o Huntingdon insteid. Hendrie haed broken his earlier wadd that thir lands wad aye belang the Scots croun, but the Soothron king haed the maucht an the impire tae daunton the laddie king. Haudin the lands o Huntingdon, Maucom wis cawed on tae serr in Hendrie’s airmy in Fraunce in the simmer o 1159 an thay baith siegit the toun o Toulouse. Here Maucom wis knichtit bi the Inglis king, but baith haed tae draw awa tae Normandy whan King Lewis o Fraunce turnt up wi his ain airmy. But noo Maucom’s weys haed the auld nobles o Scotland asteer. In 1160 he won back hame an gaed tae Perth. Fergus the rí o Gallowa pit hisel at the heid o a curn nobles an siegit the king in Perth. Thay didna like thair king gauin ootland an serrin in a fremmit airmy as anither cheil’s vassal. But Maucom’s Norman knichts brak the siege. Syne, thay lichtit on Gallowa, for tae gie Fergus a paikin, an the auld rí wis made tae demit his lands til his twa sons, Uchtred an Gilbert. Fae noo on, Maucom’s faimly regairdit Gallowa no as a kingship but as a lordship tae be held fae him throu Norman-style chairter. It wis in this time that Maucom strengthend ties wi fremmit rulers. His mither, the queen dowriar Ada, wis a kenspeckle body at the Scots coort an she wis affsprung fae Hendrie I o Fraunce. Maucom’s sister Magret wis mairried on Conan duik o Bertany in 1160, an anither sister, Ada, wis mairried on Florence coont o Holland in 1161 or 1162. In the wast, in Argyll an the isles, Sumerleid the rí o Argyll warsled wi baith the king o Man an the king o Scots. Ab.1154 Gothreid, king o Man, haed become the ‘man’ o the king o Norrowa, makkin this offeecial for the first time, tho the kings o Norrowa haed lang claimed owerlordship ower Man an the lave o the isles. But in 1156 Sumerleid o Argyll focht an defait Gothreid an syne drave him oot in 1158. Sumerleid an his faimly noo rang ower aw the isles but Lewis an Skye, tho he wis threitent bi King Maucom’s Norman lords biggin up thair ain pouer in the Firth o Clyde. The war a fykie peace tae stert wi, but in 1164

Sumerleid led his airmy doun the Clyde an wis met at Renfrew bi Walter Aulanson, the heich stewart at the king’s coort, an the war a shairp fecht. Sumerleid wis killt, an Walter’s faimly, syne kent as the Stewarts, cam t ae haud the croun o the causay in the Clyde airt. As for King Maucom, he took no weel in the hairst o 1165 an dee'd on 9 Dezember at Jethart in the Borders. He wis burried in Dumfaurlin. Whit wey he wis cryed ‘The Maiden’ isna clear, but he wis jist 23 year auld an wis never mairried. Weelum I The Lion 1165-1214 Born in 1143, Weelum wis the second son o Prince Hendrie an Ada o Warwin. Weelum wis made king at Scoun on 24 Dezember 1165. Like his brither Maucom, he wis gey Frainchified, an wis the first Scots king tae mak common cause wi the king o Fraunce, but this wad be his undaein. Tae stert wi, Weelum got alang weel eneuch wi his neebor in Ingland, whaur he gaed in 1166 tae pey homage for the erledom o Huntingdon. This gied him the inlat tae pit forrit his faimly claims tae Cummerland an Northummerland, an he even follaed the Inglis king ower the watter tae Bertany, in the simmer, whaur it is said the Scots king took pairt in the rinks. But, bi 1173, Weelum cuidna wait ony mair tae see whither the norlan shires o Ingland wad be judged his, an he jyned a hantle fowk – the king o Fraunce comprehendit - in a rising agin the king o Ingland. He lichtit on the border wi an airmy tae mak guid his claim an ettled at a siege o the important castle at Anneik in Northummerland. In 1174 he got aheid o his airmy, alang wi a puckle Frainch an Fleemish knichts, an made camp. But ae morning his sma pairty wis ambusht wi a curn norlan barons o Ingland, an Weelum took a lance til his horse, leain him preened tae the grund. His men slauchtert, King Weelum wis taen presonar, an cairried awa tae Normandy whaur the Inglis king wis. The Inglis king, Hendrie II, wadna lowse Weelum til he gree’d tae the bemeanin Treaty o Falaise, sealt on 1 Dezember 1174. Bi the terms o this, Weelum wis noo tae pey homage til Hendrie II, no jist for lands held in Ingland, but for the kinrik o Scotland forby. An for tae mak shair the treaty wis upheld, hostages wad be gien ower, an the hooses o strength at Berrick, Embra, an Roxbra fillt wi Soothron sodgers. But Hendrie o Ingland wisna feenisht. He wantit the bishops o Scotland tae mak thairsels subject tae the kirk in Ingland. Hooanever, the bishops o Scotland wis eident in the defence o thair richts, an for the kinrik. At a cooncil held in 1176 thay wadna gree tae be subjectit til Ingland. The paip in Rome wis in a swither, an pit the

maiter aff in 1179, an affcome that weel suitit the Scots. An sae the maiter o the kirk in Scotland wis left hingin, but Weelum haed sairly duntit his croun. While thir debates haed been gauin on, the men o Gallowa fell tae fechtin amang thairsels. The twa brithers, lords Uchtred an Gilbert, focht ane anither for the hail lordship. The king’s Norman lords thareawa fund thairsels siegit an killt, an syne Gilbert took Uchtred an cuttit oot his tongue. It wis 1176 afore King Weelum dauntont Gilbert, at the command o his owerlord King Hendrie. It wis wi the blissin o his owerlord that Weelum, aged 42, wis mairried on Armangarda o Beaumont, dochter o Richert vicoont o Beaumont, in Fraunce, an Constance o Maine. The mairrage took place on 5 September 1186 at Woodstock, by Oxfuird in Ingland. Weelum haed tae thole his vassal staunin til Hendrie o Ingland dee’d. The new king, Richert, syne kent as the Lionhertit, wis wantin siller for his crusade. In Dezember 1189, in a gaithering held at Caunterberry, a new treaty wis made atween the kings. The auld treaty o Falaise wis elidit, an King Weelum noo bocht back his freedom - an the freedom o Scotland – for the sum o 10,000 merks in gowd an siller. Fae noo on, the Soothron king gree’d, Scotland wad be as freenstaunin as it haed been in the days o Weelum’s brither Maucom, an ony homage peyed bi the Scots king wad be for his Inglis estates alane. Weelum haed twa problems in his kinrik, ane sib tae the ither. Ane wis the ongauin claim o the faimly o Weelum Duncanson tae the croun – a claim that wis a guid ane – an the ither wis the maucht o Harald erle o Orkney. Harald haed seen aff his faes in 1158, leain him maister o the hail o Caitnes an Orkney his lane, an he wis mairried on the kinred o Maucom Sanderson. This maks sense o his uphaud o the kinred o Weelum Duncanson, itherwise kent as the MacWeelums. In 1179 thay rose up, an King Weelum haed tae gae north. He pusht up intae Ross an biggit castles alang the Cromarty Firth but this didna stop Donal MacWeelum bringin in an airmy in 1181. For a puckle year the twa sides warsled wi ane anither until, in the simmer o 1187, the king’s men, heidit bi Roland lord o Gallowa, happent tae meet i n wi Donal at a steid cryed Mam Garbh (or ‘rauch hill’) north o Innerness. The war a shairp fecht an Donal wis killt. Roland haed Donal’s heid sindert an sent tae Weelum as a gift. Erle Harald, meanwhile, haed taen the wrang side in the ceevil weir in Norrowa, an the king o Norrowa took Shetland aff o him in 1195. Bishop John o Caitnes didna get alang wi Harald either an steert King Weelum agin the Orkney erle. In 1196 King Weelum led an airmy the length o Thursa an dauntont Harald, but the follaein year Ha rald’s son Thorfinn focht agin the king’s men at Innerness. Harald wis claucht, haed his lands in Scotland forfeitit, an jyled for a time, an his son Thorfinn blindit an mankit. In 1201 Bishop John clyped tae King Weelum that Harald wis haein dealings wi the king o Ingland an syne Harald’s men ill-hurtit the bishop. Weelum maircht north aince mair, but a greement wis made whaurby Harald wad haud Caitnes but pey a tribute tae the Scots king. An sae things stood whan Harald dee’d in 1206. King Weelum haed pusht his rule intae Caitnes, Sutherland an Ross, an he wantit tae redd up the staunin o the kirk in Scotland, that the bishops o Caunterberry an York haed baith been claimin authority ower. The maiter haed been left hingin, but in 1192 Paip Celestine’s decr eet declared that the Ecclesia Scotticana, or kirk in Scotland, wis subject tae nane but the paip as his ain byous dochter kirk. Alang wi this, an maist likely at the fleitchin o

kirkmen, the king’s chauncery drappit the auld form o addressin fowk in chairters conform tae thair ethnic backgrund, whither as Frainch, Inglis, Scots, or whitever. Clearly it haed come tae some cheil’s mind that addressin fowk this wey upheld the sindry ethnic springheids. Insteid, the chauncery unner King Weelum noo addresst fowk jist as the king’s guid subjects. In 1198 Queen Armangarda haed gien birth til a son, cryed Alisaunder. This meant that the croun wad haud-gauin in Weelum’s line, sae lang as naebody upheld the richts o the MacWeelums. The king, noo auld an aiblins donnert gettin, wis maist fasht that his son wad follae him athoot ony weir. This is whit wey Weelum wis sweirt tae get intae mischief wi King John o Ingland, even whan John was actin it, but nanetheless trouble cam in 1209. The Inglis haed biggit a new castle at the border, Weelum didna like it, the twa fell oot, an John brocht an airmy north. Peace wis made, an Weelum haundit ower his twa dochters, Magret an Isabella, tae be mairried aff in Ingland. He wis aye in howp that the Inglis king micht gie him a haunder agin the MacWeelums. The storm cam in the simmer o 1211. Gothreid MacWeelum landit fae Irland wi an airmy an steidit hisel in Ross. Aince mair the auld king haed tae come north. The war blatters back an forrit, the king biggit forts, Gothreid brunt them doun, an sae an on. In the hairst Weelum haed tae withdraw. At the hinnerend it wis Gothreid’s ain men that turnt him in throu the simmer o 1212. He wis taen tae the king’s castle in the Mearns an wis heidit in front o 14 year auld Prince Alisaunder. King Weelum, noo 69, traivelled throu the Borders, an syne tae Moray whaur he haed dealings wi Erle John o Caitnes, but he took no weel on the wey sooth. He dee’d on 4 Dezember 1214 at Stirlin castle an wis burried on 10 Dezember in the abbey he haed foondit at Arbroath. He is the langest rulin king o Scots at forty nine year. He haed been an aye-gauin king, witnessin chairters fae the Borders tae Moray, tho Embra an Perth wis maist faurben wi him. Whit wey he is kent tae history as ‘the lion’ isna clear. Weelum’s wife Queen Armangarda dee'd 11 Februar 1234 an wis burried at Balmairnie abbey, in Fife.

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 8
Walcome tae pairt echt o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear aboot the stoushie ower the croun that led tae the lang weirs atween Ingland an Scotland. HOOSE O NORROWA Magret The Maiden o Norrowa 1286-1290 Born afore 9 Aprile 1283, Magret wis the dochter o Eric king o Norrowa an Magret dochter o Alisaunder III an Magret Plantagenet. The dowriar Queen Yolande wis haein the deid king’s bairn, a seetiation that haed awbody in a swither, but she miscairried. Wi her granfaither, twa uncles, an mither aw deid, Magret o Norrowa wis the ae heir tae the croun o Scotland, gauin bi the rule o primogeniture. The throne noo passt tae the kingly hoose o Norrowa, makkin it like that a Norse faimly wad rule ower Scotland. In Aprile 1286 sax lords, kent in Latin as custodes, or guardians, wis waled tae rule ower the kinrik on behauf o wee, faur-awa Queen Magret. Thir lords wis Alisaunder Cummin erle o Buchan, Duncan erle o Fife, Weelum Frazer bishop o Saunt Aundraes, Robert Wishart bishop o Glesca, John Cummin o Badenoch, an Jeems the Heich Stewart. The guardians haed the burden o keepin the hail kinrik peacified, no easy athoot the respect that a king alane cuid command. Duncan o Fife wis murdert in 1289, an Alisaunder o Buchan dee'd the same year. The king o Ingland – Edwart Langshanks – pit it tae the Scots that a treaty o mairrage atween the queen an his ain son wad jyne the twa kinriks in peace. Tae mony o the nobles, haein lands in baith the kinriks, it wis wicelike, but the guardians gaithert, confeered, an intimate that ony mairrage treaty wad want the richts an freedoms o Scotland tae be respectit, as a kinrik aye apairt fae Ingland. Thay war cannie eneuch tae bring mony ither nobles, barons an kirkmen, forspeakers for the hail political community, intae the body o the trokin. Bi the Treaty o Birram gree’d on 18 July 1290, Queen Magret wis trystit til Edwart prince o Ingland. Even afore this, in Juin 1290, Edwart Langshanks shawed his haun bi takkin ower the Isle o Man, or as he pit it, giein beild tae the fowk. An the Soothron king wis wantin the guardians tae eik his ain appyntit factors amang thair cooncil. But, awthing wis pit in an affa steer in the hairst. On the wey ower fae Norrowa, Queen Magret took no weel an the wee sowel dee’d at Kirkwal, courried in the airms o the bishop o Orkney, on 26 September 1290. She wis taen back tae Norrowa an burried at Birren kirk. It wisna appearant whit body wis the richtfae heir, an the heidmaist nobles noo gaed aboot bodin in fear o weir. THE MUCKLE CAUSE 1290-1292 Whit the community maist feart – a kingless kinrik – haed come aboot. Robert Bruce o Annandale, an John Balliol o Gallowa, noo pit forrit claims tae the croun. Baith wis the affspring o Erle Dauvit o Huntingdon, brither o Weelum

the Lion. Bruce wis his granson, while Balliol wis his ieroe. Weelum Frazer bishop o Saunt Aundraes noo wrate til Edwart Langshanks, an askit him as a guid neebor, an kinsman o the deid queen, tae come an keep the peace, feart that a ceevil weir wisna faur aff. Bi the ware o 1291 the Inglis king haed even been askit tae judge whit noble haed the best claim. Edwart wis gled tae, sae lang as the guardians awned him as owerlord o Scotland. Tae dae mense tae the guardians, thair reply wis that naebody but a king cuid answer sic a claim – an thay didna ken thairsels o ony sic claim - but thay didna think that he, Edwart, wad mak it unless he thocht he haed the richt. It wis a rare bootgait that haed Edwart in a swither. The Inglis king joukit this tickler bi makkin the fourteen claimants tae the croun sweir fealty directly til him. In Juin 1291 the guardians demitit office but wis appyntit again, this time on Edwart’s say. Thay an ithers o the kinrik swure fealty til Edwart as superior dominus, or owerlord, on 13 Juin 1291 at Norham. On 2 August a coort at Berrick stertit hearin the Muckle Cause, or law pleas o the claimants tae the croun. The guardians bade in office atween hauns til the coort fund in favour o John Balliol as king, in November 1292. HOOSE O BALLIOL (I) John Tuim Tabard 1292-1296 Born ab.1250, John wis the son o John Balliol an Devorgilla o Gallowa. John haed awready been mairried on Isabella o Warwin, dochter o John o Warwin 3rd erle o Surrey an Alice Le Brun o Mairch. The coort in the kingship cause fund on 17 November 1292 that John shuid be king as the cheil sprung fae the line o the eldest dochter o Erle Dauvit. He wis crount 30 November 1292 at Scoun, but it wis weel seen that Edwart regairdit John his vassal king. In Dezember, no lang efter John wis made king, a burgess o Berrick appealed tae Langshanks agin judgements in a Scots coort. The king o Ingland made it clear that he wad hear appeals fae John’s subjects an wad summon John til Ingland whan necessar. In 1293 this is the weird that John haed tae dree whan he wis bemeaned afore the Inglis pairlament. It wisna lang afore mony o the Scots nobles scunnert at the wey that the croun wis ill-haunled. But demands bi Langshanks in the simmer o 1294 for Scots tae serr in his weir agin Fraunce, daein skaith tae Scots tred, wis ower muckle, an a cooncil o nobles took ower in King John’s name in the simmer o the follaein year. Weelum Frazer bishop o Saunt Aundraes noo heidit an ambassadry tae Fraunce, an on 23 October 1295 a treaty wi King Philip wis gree’d agin Ingland. This is affen thocht o as the stert o the sae cryed Auld Alliance, but Fraunce an Scotland haed awready been makkin common cause agin Ingland fae the 1170’s onwards. Weir cam in Mairch 1296. It wis the Scots that strak first, led bi King John’s kinsmen the Cummins. The Bruce faimly, claimants tae the croun, an unfreens o the Balliols, wadna serr John. Langshanks brocht up his airmy, siegit an spylt Berrick, slauchterin its fowk, an syne defait a Scots airmy at Dunbar on 27 Aprile. The Scots didna ken whit haed dung them. Langshanks breenged up the east coast an King John randert hisel. On 10 July at Brechin John wis made tae demit his croun an wis cairried awa a presonar tae Lunnon. Acause the kingly airms on his tabard or coat wis torn aff, he wis kent evermair as tuim tabard. At the hinnerend he wis gien ower tae the custody o the paip an dee'd in Aprile 1313 at Bailleul-en-Gouffern in Normandy. He wis likely burried thareawa.

GUARDIANS ATWEEN KINGS 1296-1306 In the ware an simmer o 1296 Langshanks maircht roon Scotland takkin aiths o fealty an cairryin awa the registers an ensigny o Scotland as a freestaunin kinrik. Edwart wis a king o muckle maucht that’s veeson o hisel wis as imperor ower the hail Breetish Isles. At a pairlament held at Berrick on 28 August Edwart set oot the wey Scotland wis tae be run, like Wales, as a province. John o Warwin erle o Surrey, guid-faither o John Balliol, wis appyntit lutenant o the Inglis-usurpit airts bi Edwart in September 1296 but Warwin’s authority brak doun in mony airts an his lutenancy endit in August 1297. A puckle Scots nobles cockit a neive at Langshanks but it wis the lesser lairds an common fowk, steert up bi Soothron tax gaitherars, that stertit heather weirs in the ware o 1297. The twa heidmaist Scots wis Sir Andra Murray (in the north) an Weelum Wallace (in the sooth). Sir Weelum Wallace Born ab.1270, Weelum wis the son o Aulan Wallace a memmer o the Hoose o Elderslie. Wallace, alang wi Sir Andra Murray, defait the Inglis unner thair thesaurar Sir Hew Cassinghame at Stirlin Brig on 11 September 1297. Murray wis hurtit tae the deith an dee'd in the November but no afore he an Wallace sent oot letters as ‘heids o the airmy o Scotland’ tae German merchants for tae lat them ken that Scotland wis lowsed fae Inglis pouer. Atween September 1297 an Mairch 1298, Wallace wis appyntit guardian his lane an heidit the community o the kinrik o Scotland agin the Inglis invader. But acause he focht in the name o King John, a hantle nobles, sic as the Bruces, wis sweirt tae follae him. But Wallace noo haed tae tak on the hail micht o Langshanks in the simmer. Wallace haed a puckle knichts unner Sir John the Rid Cummin an airchers unner Sir John Stewart, but at the Fawkirk, on 22 July 1298, Edwart blootert Wallace wi an airmy o 18,000, comprehendin Earse sodgers, Frainch knichts an Welsh langbowmen. In the eftercome, an bi Dezember at latest, Wallace demitit his guardianship an gied ower tae jynt guardians in the free airts o Scotland. In 1299 he gaed tae Fraunce an Norrowa, seekin a haun agin Ingland. Efter the appearant faw o Scotland, in 1304, Wallace took tae the heather until he wis betrayed tae Langshanks, taen tae Lunnon, an pit tae deith wi Jethart justice on 23 August 1305. Awmaist alane amang ither Scots, Wallace never awned Edwart as owerlord, an aye focht for the community o Scotland. For aw the auld fernyears, Scots doun throu aw the ages haes richtly seen Wallace as a hero. Jynt Guardians Robert Bruce o Annandale, son o the claimant, wis appyntit jynt guardian bi a noble cooncil at the dowp-end o 1298 but cuidna wirk wi his

political-brither John The Rid Cummin o Badenoch. Bruce demitit in 1300, an syne gaed ower tae Langshanks. John Cummin cairried on the fecht in the name o King John, an wis jyned bi Bishop Weelum Lamberton o Saunt Aundraes an Ingeram Umfra, but aw demitit office in 1301. A kenspeckle, an patriotic body, that maist fowk haes forgotten nooadays, wis Sir John Soules. He took ower fae the Cummin, Bishop Weelum an Umfra at the stert o 1301 an bade in office til the hairst o 1302 whan he gaed tae Pairis on ambassadry. John Cummin appearinly took ower as guardian aince mair fae John Soules, winnin a fecht agin the Inglis at Rosslin in 1303. But Langshanks weirit Cummin doun until Cummin, alang wi ither heids o kin, randert thairsels at Strathord by Perth, on 9 Februar 1304, wi the terms confirmed at a pairlament held in Saunt Aundraes in Mairch. In September 1305 Edwart set oot his ettles for the kintra and appyntit a comatee o ten Scots an ten Inglis tae pit oot ordinances for the admeenistration o the 'land' o Scotland. Atween the simmer o 1305 an Mairch 1306 the war naebody in Scotland wi the maucht tae daunton, but the usurpin airmy o the king o Ingland.

Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses: Pairt 9
Walcome tae pairt nine o Scotland’s Ain Kingly Hooses. In this pairt we hear hoo Robert The Bruce haed hisel made king an set aboot his unfreens at hame an the Soothron invaders forby. HOOSE O THE BRUCE Robert I The Bruce 1306-1329 Born 11 July 1274 at Turnberry castle, Ayrshire, Robert wis the son o Robert Bruce o Annandale an erle o Carrick, an Magret coontess o Carrick. The Bruce faimly wis sprung fae the line o Erle Dauvit o Huntingdon an haed a guid claim on the croun o Scotland. His faither – an hisel – chenged sides in the weirs, whiles fechtin for the guardians an whiles for Edwart Langshanks o Ingland. Back an forrit the faimly gaed. It aw lippent on whither or no the guardians upheld Balliol or Bruce claims tae the croun an whither or no Langshanks micht ‘gie’ the croun tae the Bruces, pittin the faimly in an affa swither. The young Robert’s mairrages is a clear sign o his ambeetion. Aboot 1295 he wis mairried on Isabel o Mar, the dochter o Donal erle o Mar bi his wife Helen o Gwynedd. Helen wis, in turn, the dochter o Lewellen prince o Wales. This mairrage melled the kingly lines o Scotland an Wales. Isabel an Robert haed a dochter Merjory but Isabel dee’d in 1296. Sometime in 1302 Robert took a second wife, Leezabeth o Burgh. She wis the dochter o Richert o Burgh the Rid Erle o Ulster bi his kizzen Magret o Burgh. A rare choice for a guid-faither, the Rid Erle wis the maist pouerfae cheil in Irland that’s maucht striddled the sheuch atween the twa kintras. Robert’s ain faither, the erle o Carrick, dee’d in Aprile 1304, makkin him heid o the faimly. He haed lands an richts in his aucht, baith in Ingland and Scotland, an wis noo weel quotit in Lunnon, but in 1305 it wis weel seen that Langshanks wantit Scotland as naething mair but a pendicle o Ingland, a crounless, conquest land. Robert haed awready made a baund, or greement, in hidlins, wi Weelum Lamberton bishop o Saunt Aundraes. The twa gree’d tae gie the ither a haunder aince the time cam, an noo Robert gaed efter the croun. The ae-maist cheil that stood in his road wis John The Rid Cummin o Badenoch that haed aince serred as a guardian. In Februar 1306 the twa held a tryst at the Greyfreears kirk in Dumfries. Ane word soon fasht anither, an whither it wis his ettle or no, the Bruce pullt oot a dagger an stickit the man. Tradeetion threaps that Bruce said ‘A think A’v killt the Cummin’ an that ane o his follaers replied ‘A’ll mak siccar’. Whitever the truth, the Cummin wis hurtit tae the deith, an Robert haed commitit murder on haly grund. The war nae wey back sae Robert gaithert a wheen follaers an haed hisel crount king o Scots at Scoun on 25 Mairch 1306. Robert Wishart, bishop o Glesca, noo fleitcht fowk in King Robert’s cause an syne the Guid Sir Jeems Dooglas cam forrit tae fecht for him. Aince Langshanks learnt that aw his weirs haed appearinly been for naething, it gart him beel. In the simmer a Soothron airmy

made its wey north plenishin itsel fae the castles an hooses o strength in Scotland that wis yet in the Edwart ane’s aucht. An he cuid aye lippen on the kinsmen o the murdert Cummin. The Bruce gaithert a sma airmy, but he wis near defait - afore he got stertit - at Meffen in Perthshire, on 19 Juin, an haed tae flee intil Argyll whaur he wis blootert a second time at Dalry on 11 August bi Lord John MacDougal o Lorne. Bruce’s airmy gaed aw tae staps an awbody haed tae shift for thairsels. Langshanks noo took bluidy vengeance on aw Bruce’s freens an kinsfowk. Bishops Lamberton an Wishart wis taen presonar an sent in cheens tae jyles in Ingland. Sir Simon Fraser, claucht at Meffen, wis drawn an hung in Lunnon. Queen Leezabeth an Princess Merjory, sent north, wis capturt at Tain an sent til Ingland an-aw. Mary Bruce, King Robert’s sister, an Isabel o Fife, that haed pit the croun on Robert’s heid at Scoun, wis gien the jyle in cages at Roxbra an Berrick. An the king’s brithers, Alisaunder, Neil an Tamas, wis drawn, heidit an quartert. Aiblins fleein first til Irland, syne King Robert landit in Carrick an Gallowa aboot Februar or Mairch 1307. In the Aprile he defait an Inglis airmy at Glen Trool, an aince mair at Loudoun Hill on 10 Mey. Noo awthing chenged. The tirran Langshanks dee’d in July an the Bruce set aboot blooterin his unfreens. Buchan, the Cummin faimly hertland, wis herried an brunt in 1308, an Weelum erle o Ross, aince an inemy, noo jyned King Robert. Scots that wadna come ower tae the Bruce wis hung as traitors. For twa-three year Scotland wis tore in twa. The hinmaist o the king’s inemies in Scotland, John MacDougal o Lorne, haed been defait bi the stert o 1309, an the king cuid even haud his first pairlament, at Saunt Aundraes, in Mairch. At thon pairlament diplomatic dealings wi King Philip IV o Fraunce wis restored, an mony kirkmen an nobles declared that Robert wis the richtfae king o Scots. This wis follaed wi a treaty atween King Robert an King Acho V o Norrowa, sealt at Innerness in October 1312. Robert haed awready turnt his een on the lands sooth o the Forth that haed been usurpit bi the Inglis. Ding dang the castles held bi the Inglis fell tae Bruce’s men led bi his brither Edwart Bruce, the Guid Sir Jeems Dooglas, Jeems The Stewart, an Tamas Randal the king’s nevey. Bruce haed mony castles cawed doun sae that the inemy cuidna haud them for steidin airmies, while his policy wis tae bicker the Inglis oot the kinrik. In the simmer o 1313 the king’s brither, Edwart Bruce, efter siegin the castle o Stirlin, gree’d wi its commander that unless an airmy fae Ingland relieved it bi midsimmer the year efter, it wad be randert tae the Scots. King Robert gied his brither an upreddin for committin them til a fecht in the open field ower the

heid o ae castle. In Juin 1314 the Inglis king, Edwart II, brocht a muckle airmy intae Scotland for tae relieve Stirlin: Inglis, Frainch, Fleemings, Germans, Earse an Welsh sodgers made up an airmy nummerin mibby 20,000. It is jaloused that Bruce haed aboot 7,500 men. While the Scots focht for thair kintra, the Soothron airmy wis hauf-hertit. The twa met at the Bannock Burn on 23 an 24 Juin. On the first day, an Inglis knicht, cryed Bohun, sichtit King Robert an breenged at him. At the deith, King Robert joukit, brocht his aix doun throu Bohun’s helmet, intil his harns, an cleaved his heid in twa. This sicht fair kittled the Scots airmy. On the second day the Scots schiltrons, or spearmen, follaed wi licht horse unner Sir Robert Keith, brak the Soothron airmy. It gied backs, an mony drount in the watters o the Forth. The Inglis king fled ower the border but wis that thrawart that he wadna allou that Scotland wisna his, an wadna awn Robert as king o Scots. The Scots haed taen mony presonars, an muckle gear, an noo Scots captives in Ingland wis lowsed. Queen Leezabeth an Princess Merjory baith cam hame. Fae 1311 the Scots haed been lichtin on the north o Ingland, whiles burnin, whiles stentin touns. King Robert an his brither Edwart, an the Guid Sir Jeems Dooglas, noo lowsed deidly raids on Ingland as ane wey tae scunner Edwart II intae makkin peace. The toun o Berrick, claucht bi Langshanks years afore, wi taen back bi Scotland in 1318. Scots airmies invadit the length o York, an took siller aff o touns as the price for no makkin a greeshoch oot them. A second front wis opent up in Irland atween 1314 an 1327. Edwart Bruce took an airmy ower an haed hisel made king o Irland, afore he wis killt in 1318, but the fechtin thareawa left a land aw tae sticks. Robert noo tried diplomacy wi the paip tae get him tae awn his teetle an mak Ingland dae likewise. In 1320 mony barons pit thair seals tae the Screive fae Arbroath, wrutten bi Bernart Linton, an sent it tae the Paip John in Rome. It wis a screive threapin on the lang, free history o the Scots kingship, the ettle o the Scots tae staun free, thair acceptance o Bruce as king, an settin oot the wrangs done tae them bi Ingland. But the Scots gaed forder. Thay tellt the paip that shuid Robert no uphaud Scotland or its fowk as a freestaunin kinrik, or shuid he subject them tae the Inglis, thay wad turn him oot an mak anither king. Thay declared ‘Sae lang as a hunner o us is in life, we winna thole the rule o the Inglis. We daena fecht for fame or riches, but for freedom alane, that nae guid man gies up but wi life itsel’. This Screive, an the political ettles ahin it, stauns its lane in Europe as a voice o national identity. The paip an king o Fraunce threapit on peace tae the king o Ingland, an Robert made a treaty o alliance wi Chairles IV o Fraunce in Aprile 1326 whaurby ilk ane gree’d tae help the ither agin ony invasion f ae Ingland. In 1327 Edwart wis made tae demit his croun til his son, Edwart III, a laddie o 14 year auld that wantit tae gie the Scots a paikin. King Robert haimmert the north o Ingland thon year, his airmies hurlin back an forrit, devalin, the screivar John le Bel said, for tae mak an eat ait cakes, an syne awa again, leadin the stervin Soothrons a merry jig. Efter the Guid Sir Jeems haed nearly taen the young Inglis king a presonar, by Durham, the Soothrons speirt aboot peace. The affcome wis the Treaty o Embra, gree’d in Mairch 1328, whaurby the king o Ingland gied up aw claims til owerlordship an awned that Robert wis the richtfae king o a freestaunin Scotland. Tae mak the peace mair shair Bruce’s son Dauvit wis mairried on Jean the Inglis king’s sister, at Berrick on 12 July 1328. Dauvit wis fower year auld an Jean wis seeven. The Scots

cryed thair new prince’s bride Jean Mak Peace. Afore this Queen Leezabeth haed dee’d 26 October 1327 at Cullen, Banff, an wis burried in Dumfaurlin abbey. Even while makkin the treaty o peace at Embra, King Robert haedna been weel, an wis in his bed at Halyrood whan the terms wis gree’d. It is thocht that he haed taen leprosy, an he dee'd 7 Juin 1329 at Cardross. He wis burried at Dumfaurlin Abbey alang wi his wife. Robert haed chenged sides as a young man, he haed murdert, an tae some wis a usurper, but he haed proven hisel an haed uphauden the freedom o the kinrik, an tae this day, Robert I richtly stauns his lane as the hero king o Scots.
