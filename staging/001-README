STAGING: contains pairs that build and have an advanced status
of all modules (dictionaries with closed categories and a decent
coverage, an "ad hoc" PoS tagset and .prob, good coverage of main
contrastive phenomena, testvoc clean, and a post-generator if needed).

There should be a "PROBLEMS" file saying: status and major
problems found while reading translations done with this pair (so, not
a complete evaluation but a general compilation of big problems
detected at the output).
