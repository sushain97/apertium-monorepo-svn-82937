Esperanto--French

These are the linguistic data for the Apertium Esperanto--French machine translator. 
You need apertium-3.2.0 and lttoolbox-3.2.0 to use this translator.

To compile the linguistical data simply do inside of this directory:

$ ./configure

to generate a Makefile file and then

$ make
# make install

("make install" is not compulsory; it is useful only if you don't want to type the directory parameter when running the translator)


RUNNING

echo "Voil√† mon texte" | apertium fra-epo
echo "Jen mia teksto"  | apertium epo-fra

(type "apertium" to see the different avalaible parameters)


MODES

Now, both French to Esperanto and Esperanto to French are supported.

In the previous version (apertium-eo-fr in trunk), there was a mode
fr-eo-bytecode which was equivalent to fr-eo mode, but faster for
huge texts. The problem was it generated compilations errors if
java is not installed and running correctly.

Presently, this mode has been deleted. A better solution could be
to give the choice between 2 versions of modes.xml and makefile.am
files to allow each possibility.


TAGGER 

To use this language-pair package with apertium YOU DO NOT NEED TO
RETRAIN THE TAGGER. Probabilities and auxiliary data are provided for
both the epo-fra and the fra-epo translation directions which should be
acceptable for most applications, and should work even if you change
the dictionaries in a reasonable way.

If for some reason you need to retrain the tagger (for example, you
have made really extensive changes to the dictionaries such as
creating new lexical categories), see the documentation on our wiki
at: http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Tagger_training.
