# Required packages

python 2.6
feedparser
django 1.1.1

# Todos

 * RSS feeds from translated news

 * Parser models for each feed type
	- Use xmllib2, may be faster than ElementTree, and more extended xpath support: http://simonwillison.net/2003/Oct/21/xpathRocks/
	
	- mechanize: http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/

 * Get it running on victorio

 * Move apertium paths and such into settings.py

 * Try with another language pair?
	-> Feed models will need to specify source and target language
