The file apertium-en-hi.hi(unicode-merged).dix contains all the entries which were in WX notation converted to UTF.
It has been merged with the existing dix which had unicode entries.
The WX file has now been completely converted to UTF.
The file is now in working condition.
Next-to-do:
1.The file, though in working condition, hasn't been fully standardized yet.
2.The bidix in the incubator has the hindi entries in WX notation. They need to be converted to UTF.
