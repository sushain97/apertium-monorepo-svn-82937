Sorted entries of bilingual dictionary; removed duplicated entries;
     Large sublexicons (i.e. nouns) are divided alphabetically by the
     first letter, from the second letter on words are sorted how
     "M-x sort-lines" command of Emacs preffers it to do.

WHY: 1. Mainly to have real numbers about how much stems we got.

WHAT (may be) NEXT: 1. Check the bilingual dictionary for POS-miscategorizations;
                    2. Update lexc files to the bilingual dictionary (kind of "align"
                       them with bdix).
