==Installation==

You will first need to install:

* lttoolbox
* Apertium
* HFST
* VISLCG3

Then just run:

$ ./autogen.sh 

or 

$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/path/to/your/prefix

and 

$ make

You should be able to test the translator with:

$ echo "Ahmet okula gitti." | apertium -d . tur-kir
Ахмет мектепке кетти.

==Development==

The Constraint Grammar of Turkish, file apertium-tur-kir.tur-kir.rlx
should be kept up to date with the version in the apertium-tur
directory. That means that if you make any changes here, you should
also make them there. And if there are any change made there, they
should also be made here.
