In order to use oooapertium you need this depends (at least):

	- Openoffice >=2.4
	- python-uno
	- python-dbus
	- apertium-dbus
	- apertium
	- Some apertium lang packs (apertium-es-ca,...)

To do a local installation, is enough to execute:

	unopkg add oooapertium-x.x.x.zip

If you need/want a global one:
	
	unopkg add -shared oooapertium-x.x.x.zip

If you want to build and try in debug mode:

	make test
