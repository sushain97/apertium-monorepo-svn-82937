DESCRIPTION

TinyLex is a J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition) program for mobile devices which
looks up dictionary entries. It is free software and released under the
terms of the GNU General Public License v2.0.

BUILD

It is recommended to open this project with Netbeans before (only the first
time). This will create a 'private' directory inside 'nbproject' with some user properties.

After that:

$ ant jar-all

This will configure and build TinyLex for each language pair (currently
ca-ro, en-es, en-ca, fr-ca, fr-es, es-ca, es-gl, es-pt, oc-ca).

After building, JAR and JAD files are placed in 'dist' directory.

QUICKSTART

Copy/send the .jar file to your mobile device.

dist/en_es/en-es-apertium-tinylex-0.2.jar
dist/es_ca/es-ca-apertium-tinylex-0.2.jar
dist/fr_ca/fr-ca-apertium-tinylex-0.2.jar
...

Have fun!
