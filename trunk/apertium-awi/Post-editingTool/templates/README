I/ Directory Organisation
---------------

In the root (./templates/), there are this file(README)
and the file "avalaible_languages".

The README explains how the directory is organised, and
how managed interface translation.
The "avalaible_languages" lists languages avalaible,
ie languages for which translation exists.

For each avalaible language, there is a directory named
by the language.
In this directory, there are some file:
index - Contains translation for the home page,
        in a specific order
translate - Contains translation for the translate page,
            in a specific order
module_name - Contains translation for the module name,
              ie the file for the module Logs is 
              module_Logs, in a specific order

The correspondence between the order in the file, and
the signification, is write in the file
../includes/formats.php: function retrieve_info
For example, a module file is organised as:
name
description
text for button_in
text for button_out

II/ How to managed interface translation
---------------

The text is displayed in page by the call of the function
get_text(page, information requested), or
write_text(page, information requested). For example, the
title of the home page is get by 
get_text('index', 'title');
If you want to add text in page, or add page, you have to
write the correspondence in the file format.php.
In this example, the correspondence is 
index->title : first line of the file index

If you want to add a language, for example the espanol,
you have to write all file corresponding, who contain 
translation, in a directory es/, ie
es/index, es/translate, es/module_Logs, ...
and add the name of language in ./avalaible_languages.

To modify a language, you just have to open the
adequate file, write your own translation, and save.
If you want to modify the description of the Logs module,
open en/module_Logs and change the second line.

Do not forget to commit your changes, to allow the
apertium community to use your work.

For any problem/question, you can contact me, or go on
the Apertium IRC Channel (#apertium).
