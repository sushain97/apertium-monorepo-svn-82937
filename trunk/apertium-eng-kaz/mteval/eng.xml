<seg id="2">James and  Mary in garden.</seg>
<seg id="3">The weather is nice today, warm.</seg>
<seg id="4">But yesterday it was very cold ! They could not play outside then .</seg>
<seg id="5">James and Mary love to play , they always play together in the garden in front of the big house .</seg>
<seg id="6"> James  is six years old little boy.  </seg>
<seg id="7">Girl  is his sister, she  is five years old.  </seg>
<seg id="8">James has a small dog , the dog is also in the garden now .</seg>
<seg id="9">The dog likes to play with the two children .</seg>
<seg id="10">The dog is very happy now .</seg>
<seg id="11">Does Mary also have a dog ? </seg>
<seg id="12">No , Mary does not have a dog , she has a cat .</seg>
<seg id="13">But the cat is in the house , the cat is sleeping .</seg>
<seg id="14">Their mother is in the house with the cat , she looks through the window and sees James and Mary playing .</seg>
<seg id="15">James quickly runs to a big old tree , he is hiding from Mary .</seg>
<seg id="16">Do you know why ? Mary is sitting and has her hands in front of her eyes .</seg>
<seg id="17">She can not see anything and she is counting .</seg>
<seg id="18">Why does she do that ? And what is James doing near the tree ?</seg>
<seg id="19">It is a game .</seg>
<seg id="20">When Mary has finished counting she looks around .</seg>
<seg id="21">She is searching for James : where did he go ? Did you see him ?</seg>
<seg id="22">Mary does not know where James is .</seg>
<seg id="23">She asks the dog : " Did you see James? " .</seg>
<seg id="24">But the dog can not speak of course ! </seg>
<seg id="25">So Mary gets no answer to her question .</seg>
<seg id="26">People never get an answer when they speak to dogs !</seg>
<seg id="27">Mary looks at her mother behind the window , her mother is laughing .</seg>
<seg id="28">Mary thinks that she has seen where James went : </seg>
<seg id="29">"where  James, tell !" asks.  </seg>
<seg id="30">"No,  Mary, can not tell"  she answers.  </seg>
<seg id="31">Although she probably knows where he is , she does not want to tell .</seg>
<seg id="32">Mary slowly walks through the garden .</seg>
<seg id="33">She is still trying to find James .</seg>
<seg id="34">She looks under the table and under the chairs , but James is not there .</seg>
<seg id="35">She looks everywhere but she can not find James .</seg>
<seg id="36">Then she hears a sound , it is coming from behind the big old tree .</seg>
<seg id="37">Could that be James ? There is the sound again ! She listens carefully .</seg>
<seg id="38">It is not a bird or another animal .</seg>
<seg id="39">She can hear it well now .</seg>
<seg id="40">That  have to be  James is !</seg>
<seg id="41">Then she also sees a little hand and when she walks closer she also sees his head ! </seg>
<seg id="42">" You found!" laughs.  </seg>
