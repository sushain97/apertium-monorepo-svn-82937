Scripts for generating the configuration files for simpledix.
All of them require bash (some new linux distros come with dash instead)
You need to generate both configuration files for any pair.

./getConfigFile.sh apertium-xx-yy.xx.dix
	Get the full configuration file for all the paradigms, including auxiliary, and all the info for each paradigm

./getConfigFileInteractive.sh apertium-xx-yy.xx.dix out.xml
	Get the full configuration file for the paradigms you want to be include.
	
./getConfigFile_2.sh apertium-xx-yy.xx.dix paradigms.xx-yy.txt
	Get a configuration file with the paradigms and info described on the configuration file (paradigms.xx-yy.tx).
	The configuration file will be named autoconf.xml. 
	This process takes a long time (arround 2 hours for es-ca).
