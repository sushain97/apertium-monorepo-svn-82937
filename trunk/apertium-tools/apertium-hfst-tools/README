This directory is meant to contain useful scripts for using HFST with
Apertium.

update-lexc.py
==============

`update-lexc.py` is used to concatenate a set of lexc files into one,
while excluding entries that are not in an Apertium bidix (thus
keeping the lexc file and the bidix *consistent*).

It reads a configuration file, by default called `langs.cfg`.
