@article{mulloni06,
    abstract = {Present-day machine translation technologies crucially depend on the size and quality of lexical resources. Much of recent research in
the area has been concerned with methods to build bilingual dictionaries automatically. In this paper we propose a methodology for
the automatic detection of cognates between two languages based solely on the orthography of words. From a set of known cognates,
the method induces rules capturing regularities of orthographic mutations that a word undergoes when migrating from one language
into the other. The rules are then applied as a preprocessing step before measuring the orthographic similarity between putative
cognates. As a result, the method allows to achieve an improvement in the F-measure of 11,86\% in comparison with detecting
cognates based only on the edit distance between them.},
