Browse webpages with hoverover boxes with translations.

==Requirements==

* Apertium (for apertium-deshtml and apertium-rehtml)
* lttoolbox (for lt-proc)
* turl (see below)

==Directories==

analysers/	Contains compiled analysers in lt-proc format
wordlists/	Contains wordlists, tab separated
styles/		CSS guff
js/		Contains the javascript

==Files==

cabecera.php: 	Some miscellaneous functions
index.php: 	The main page
margen.php: 	The header of each page while browsing
navegador.php: 	The frameset 
README: 	This file
tradurl.php: 	Performs the insertion of hoverboxes
turl: 		A program for re-writing <a> and <img> links in HTML
turl.c: 	C++ source for turl, generated from turl.c
turl.l: 	Lexer for turl.c
Makefile:	A Makefile for compiling turl

==How it works==

You start off with calling index.php, fills in the data, posts it to
navegador.php, this then calls margen.php (for the header with the 
URL box) and tradurl.php. 

The actual page-getting and mangling is done by tradurl.php, with help
from turl to rewrite the URLs.

==Acknowledgements==

This is heavily based on the "Surf and translate" script in the Apertium
website.
