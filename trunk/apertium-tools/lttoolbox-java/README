This is a port of the C++ version of lttoolbox, and the this first version
has been kept as close to the original is terms of structure, field and
method names and workflow to faciliate debugging and testing.

Once the code is functioning well, the next major change will be a
refactoring of the code to simplify it, made it more readable and
take advantage of some of Java's strengths.
