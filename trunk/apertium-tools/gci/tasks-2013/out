Try a few different variants and run them by your mentor, who will have final say as to what's best.  (And if you can leave a few variants around that can be switched out easily in the code, that would be good too.)  You can merge the 1-9 and 10-99 categories if you want (so you'll only need 4 shades per hue); anything under 100 stems is a very small language pair, and we don't need any more detail than that.
