Using ApertiumServerTest.jmx (JMeter)
Thread group properties:
Number of threads: 20

The variable "numDaemon" (LoadBalancer.java, line 106) tells the system how many
daemons allocate for the same pair. 0 means allocating 1 daemon, 1 means 2 daemons, etc.

Average request processing time (ms)    1335    1385    1658
Throughput (responses/minute)           887     877     717
