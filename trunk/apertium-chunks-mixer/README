This packages implements a hybrid machine translation approach that
consists in integrating bilingual chunks (sub-sentential translation
units) into a translator built using the Apertium free/open-source
rule-based machine translation platform.

The integration of bilingual chunks in an Apertium-based machine
translation system implies: (i) the application of a
dynamic-programming algorithm to compute the best coverage of the
input sentence to translate given the collection of bilingual chunks
provided; (ii) the translation of the input sentence as usual by
Apertium; and (iii) the application of a language model to choose one
of the possible translations for each of the bilingual chunks
detected.

This approach ensures that the application of Apertium structural
transfer rules is preserved.

Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To install apertium-chunks-mixer you need to have installed the SRI
Language Modeling Toolkit (http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/)

Once you have it installed, compile apertium-chunks-mixer in the
common way:

$ ./configure --with-srilm=/path/to/srilm && make

Tools are supposed to be run directly from the folder after
installation. If you have problems running
apertium-chunks-mixer-wrapper because some tools are not found, please
edit the script and modify it accordingly (it should be easy).

For more information on each program execute it without parameters.

Good luck!

Execution
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Running this tool usually implies:

1. Prepraring the collection of chunks: 

Programs sort-uniq-chunks, filter-chunks, score-chunks, and
total-count-chunks help on this task

2. Running apertium-chunks-mixer-wrapper
