To compile the different tools, do:

$ make

inside of this directory.


To install them on /usr/local , do:

$ make install

Tools will go on /usr/local/bin and man pages on /usr/local/man
You need to have write access to these directories. If not, use
the root login for that or do:

$ sudo make install

If you want to install these tools somewhere else than in /usr/local
change the install_dir value at the top of the makefile.
