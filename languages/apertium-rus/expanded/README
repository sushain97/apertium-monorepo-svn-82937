------

Basic workflow is like the following (IS talking to himself):
	1) mv expanded/current-state.txt.gz expanded/previous-state.txt.gz,
	2) fix what needs to be fixed (or added) in apertium-rus.rus.dix,
	3) compile,
	4) run ./qa.sh rus to see what consequences in the transducer your
	   changes had,
	5) if you are content with them, commit,
	
	repeat the cycle

'./qa.sh rus' in apertium-rus/ gives a diff of "previous" and "current" states.
