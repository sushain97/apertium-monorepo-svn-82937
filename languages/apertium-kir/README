==Installation==

You will first need to install:

* lttoolbox
* Apertium
* HFST
* VISLCG3

Then just run:

$ ./autogen.sh 

or 

$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/path/to/your/prefix

and 

$ make

You should be able to test the translator with:

$ echo "Ahmet okula gitti." | apertium -d . tr-ky
Ахмет мектепке кетти.

==Development==

You will need:

 http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Trmorph

If you make updates to the bilingual dictionary, you will need to run
the update script "update-trmorph.py" and recompile the local copy of
TRmorph in the directory: morph-tr.

The Constraint Grammar of Turkish, file apertium-tr-ky.tr-ky.rlx
should be kept up to date with the version in the apertium-tr-az 
language pair. That means that if you make any changes here, you should
also make them there. And if there are any change made there, they
should also be made here.
